            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Vindicator (before he entreth upon the proſecution of his ſinful buſineſs in plain terms) doth preſent a Preface to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friends, in Scripture-phraſe, like to a Phariſaical Saint, with a ſpecious ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the front of it.</head>
            <head type="sub">A true Paraphraſe of both which (as they muſt intend in reference to his Poſition) we ſhall offer the impartial and intelligent Reader, in manner and form following.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O all Lovers of Gods truth, <hi>which I call Gods truth, namely, to live in ſin and diſobedience as long as we precious Saints live in houſes of clay:</hi> grace I wiſh to you; <hi>yea, ſo much grace, as to be content to live in ſin and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Gods law, without hearkening to our enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrines:</hi> and alſo peace I wiſh you, <hi>even as much peace, as you can expect by living all your life long in ſinne; for there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God,</hi> Iſa. 57.21. through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Who is no miniſter, nor allower of ſin, but a faithful redeemer of his eminent Saints from all iniquity, Tit.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:29469:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Vindicators firſt paragraph of his Preface beginneth thus:</hi> Beloved friends, <hi>(for ſo I may call you who ſtick as cloſe to my ſinful cauſe as my skin doth to my ſinful fleſh;)</hi> Theſe are the times foretold, wherein there ſhall be a falling away <hi>from our ſinful poſitions,</hi> and defection from the faith, <hi>of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful doctrine hereafter to be named,</hi> as a forerunner of the great and terrible day, <hi>to the man of ſinne,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>and of the loſſe of our credit with all ſober and wiſe people, for our main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that ſin will remain in the beſt of Saints as long as they live in houſes of the clay that</hi> Adam <hi>our firſt parent was made out of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many falſe prophets <hi>(that is, to us and our ſinful cauſe)</hi> whoſe ſtudy and labour is to undeceive poor ſouls, (though I ſay to deceive them) if it were poſſible the very elect and choice ones, <hi>who yet fight and contend for ſin to remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live, that ſo they may not be eſteemed for better Saints then our ſelves are who live (as it is well known to our neighbours) we do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I call them men confident in an arm of fleſh (<hi>Goliah</hi>-like) <hi>to terrifie our weak ones</hi> (<hi>who know not the depths of Satan,</hi> Rev. 2.24.) <hi>from hearkning to them, becauſe to ſay ſo it maketh a great noiſe in the eares of our friends by reaſon that</hi> Jeremiah <hi>ſaith, cap.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Curſed be he that maketh fleſh his arm; though the truth is, we our ſelves are the men confident in an arm of fleſh; becauſe that ſin is called fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.19, 20 21. <hi>and therefore to be confident for ſins remaining in the beſt of Saints untill death, is to be confident in the arm of fleſh,</hi> Goliah-like, <hi>which ſignifieth (as one ſaith) fleeting away, as indeed we are like to be, for they defie the whole</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God, that is, all the prevailers of the God of this world, who blindeth the mindes of unbelievers</hi> (2 Cor. 4.4.) <hi>to make them the more hardy in a ſinful cauſe, as who more bold then blind bayard? And</hi> Goliah-like <hi>we are like to be, when little</hi> David <hi>(the lovely ſervant of God) with ſome pebble-ſtones</hi> (1 Sam. 17.4.) <hi>out of the ſtony law</hi> (Deut. 4.13.) <hi>doth hit the champion in the fore noddle, and throw him down to the earth from whence he came,</hi> Rev. 3.11.</p>
            <p>But as long as I can ſtand to it, I ſhall not <hi>(as I tell you
<pb facs="tcp:29469:3"/>in my next paragraph) be daunted by the foreſaid Prophets, who oppoſe our falſhood,</hi> however I am eſteemed among them; <hi>ſo that you my friends hug me and love me for ingaging in this ſinful quarrel, to maintain</hi> that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live,</p>
            <p>I tell them in the ſaid paragraph, that applauſe <hi>(I mean from them)</hi> ſhall not ſwell us; <hi>for we are not like to have much from them:</hi> and their diſpraiſe ſhall not deject us, <hi>ſo that you my beloved friends continue to applaud us; but if you do not, we ſhall be dead in the neſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I tell them their greatneſſe ſhall not affright us, <hi>becauſe they are but yet few; for we are as yet the greateſt in number,</hi> of what rank ſoever: <hi>and my hopes are we ſhall continue ſo, if I can but cunningly abuſe them with ſwelling word of vanity, as you ſee I do my utmoſt in this my Preface, to keep them unto us, which (I doubt)</hi> I <hi>ſhall not long do, but untill they lay bare the nakedneſſe of my Vindication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet (as I tell you in my next paragraph) <hi>I am reſolved when the glory of the God of this world lyeth at the ſtake, as it did when the Goddeſſe Diana</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 19.26, 27.) <hi>was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, and her crafts-men were like to loſe all their gain; becauſe her magn ficence was neer pulling down:</hi> And therefore beloved friends <hi>(being ſuch a people as we are)</hi> we muſt not <hi>(when ſuch Prophets do ſo openly endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive our choice ones, that they may live no longer in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that they muſt ſinne while they live here)</hi> we muſt not (I ſay) ſtand by with a guilty ſilence, <hi>as if we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed (being paſt ſhame) to maintain our ſinful-poſitions: but as we are bound by many obligations of credit, profit and pleaſure, (as I may whiſper to you in private) to defend for truth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, and withſtand the gain-ſayers of them, or we are undone as a man ſhould undo an oyſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet (as I tell you in my next paragraph) I am neither worthy of note, <hi>ſince I left my wife at</hi> Burſton <hi>neere</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich <hi>above twelve years ſince, and became a vgabond upon the face of our Engliſh earth;</hi> nor yet noted the unworthieſt, <hi>ſince I came among you at</hi> Wilton <hi>my beloved friends;</hi> no nor noted the unworthieſt among the thouſands of <hi>Levi, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:29469:4"/>I preach and appear in Print for the ſame-ſinful doctrine which they own and maintain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though I be the meaneſt of Gods ſervants for ſo doing, yet my witneſſe is in Heaven that I have endeavoured to do the worſt ſervice to Gods Church I can, <hi>even to perſwade men to a ſecurity in ſin, and never to ſtrive to mortifie</hi> all ſinne in them, becauſe I tell them in Print <hi>(though I cannot prove it by Scripture)</hi> that ſin will remain in the choice Saints as long as they live.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore this part of my ſimple and ſinful ſtuff</hi> (as I tell you in my next paragraph) I preſume to preſent to thoſe who fear the Lord (as <hi>they did,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.41. <hi>which feared God and ſerved their idols</hi>) not begging pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage from ſuch great ones as I know like not our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful doctrines (though the world do not like them for it) of a neceſſity of continuing in ſin as long as we live. But <hi>I hope I ſhall receive your patronage (my endeared friends) for the ſame: And wherein I erre in not doing my utmoſt to maintain that our ſinnes muſt remain with us while we live here,</hi> I deſire your pardon, not defence, if I do not as I ſay: <hi>though, when I have done my utmoſt, I can but perſwade weak capacities to beleeve,</hi> that the beſt Saints are (where <hi>it is without controverſie we are</hi> ſtill) in ſinne.</p>
            <p>The occaſion (as I tell you in my next paragraph) of this publiſhed Vindication (which will prove, I doubt, diſmall to us in the end,) was, a diſpute, or a conteſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I call it) on our pars) betwixt Doctor <hi>Drayton</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> on the one party, and my ſelfe and many of my dear friends on the other party, in <hi>Wilton</hi> Church, where they had preached for a poſſibility of a total mortification of ſin in this life; and in the ſaid conteſt they did openly deny for truth <hi>(as juſtly they may)</hi> the poſitions which <hi>we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and have placed in Capitall letters with boldneſſe at the beginning of our ſenſeleſſe Vindication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now although (as I tell you in my next paragraph) our points in controverſie (concerning the remaining of ſinne in the beſt of Saints as long as they live) <hi>have been ſo fully and plainly aſſerted in dark times, when men could not (though
<pb facs="tcp:29469:4"/>they looked wiſtly) ſee wood for trees, yea ſwallowed down by the credulous people, who have been over-perſwaded to believe our foreſaid poſitions for Goſpel, by reaſon we pretend the Worthies (ever ſince the Apoſtles with their Apoſtolical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine fell aſleep) of the dark times have held out our poſitions; for which I call them men of bleſſed memory, to us for, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing (as I endeavour to make the people believe) what I and the reverend Clergy of our mind maintain; though the Prophets aforeſaid are ready to call them irreverend for ſo doing: But yet we ſay to theſe oppoſites unto our tenents that they are men puft up with pride in our ſenſe, (though not in their own) for correcting</hi> Magnificat, <hi>and going about to untruſſe our points, which have been ſo fully declared to be ſound and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox; that if theſe fatal Prophets did not contradict them,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of addition to maintain our ſinful doctrine <hi>(worthy to be confuted)</hi> might ſeem ſuperfluous and unneceſſary <hi>for me, unleſſel could ſpeak more ſenſe them I do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although the proverb (as I tell you in my next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph) will be fulfilled in me (undertaking this task) <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil dictum quod non dictum priùs,</hi> I can ſpeak nothing for our ſinful cauſe <hi>(having only learned it from others, and my own long practiſe)</hi> which hath not been ſaid already; yet in regard there are many people well-willers to us, <hi>and our ſinne-maintaining cauſe (which do depend on me a ſufficient bold follow to lead them wrong)</hi> who of late have been diſturbed and unſetled from our poſitions, by reaſon of the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our gain-ſayers to oppoſe our enſuing falſhoods, (which we call truths;) and alſo many of the ſaid people are not able to buy great volumes <hi>(becauſe they are not to be had)</hi> of ſuch nonſenfical and ſinful ſtuffe as we vent in our Vindication:</p>
            <p>And likewiſe by reaſon (as I tell you in my next para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph) of the weakneſs of the capacity of our friends, <hi>who cannot eaſily apprehend (unleſs they open their eyes) the perſpicuity and plainneſs of their truths, of a poſſibility of a total mortification of ſinne in this life, from our contrary falſhead; nor yet can diſtinguiſh (unleſs they be willing to hearken to our opponents) betwixt their truth and our falſhood,</hi> by reaſon we
<pb facs="tcp:29469:5"/>have vailed our falſhood under the feigned teſtimonies (as truths vizard) of Scriptures and Fathers, which (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) they will at laſt charge me to have abuſed (both Scriptures and Fathers) moſt notoriouſly:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet for the ſatisfaction of our well-willers, and confirmation of them in falſhood, (inſtead of truth)</hi> I have <hi>(as I tell you in my next paragraph)</hi> preſented to the publick <hi>(becauſe I would have them the more taking with ſhallow capacities, who are ready (out of their carnal and blind affections to me for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſin, as aforeſaid) to believe what I ſay, right or wrong, (I have preſented a few collections pumpt out of our addle brain) which (not being ſeriouſlly digeſted nor weighed) will (I doubt not) diſenable the meaneſt capacities (being willing to be one ſtill with us in our concluſions) to diſcover the truth according to godlineſs,</hi> Tit. 1.1. <hi>from the deceitfulneſs of ſin, which we maintain will remain with us as long as we live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which others (as I tell you in my next paragraph) <hi>have done in maintaining our tenents, namely, that ſin will remain in us as aforeſaid, &amp;c.</hi> I muſt bleſs the God of this world for; <hi>by reaſon the God of the true</hi> Iſrael <hi>commandeth them who are deſirous to ſhew themſelves his Saints, to hate the garment ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the fleſh,</hi> v. 23. <hi>of</hi> Judes <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if that which I have now done ſhall be any way ſerviceable to weak capacities <hi>(which is all we can expect) to keep them where they are, in a ſinful life, and to ſtir them up to do againſt our Autagoniſts, as they did,</hi> Acts 17.5. <hi>and</hi> 19.20, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it hath obtained its ends <hi>(ex fiue rei) though I do not blad abroad in plain terms my</hi> (finem intentionis) <hi>who am willing to be ſpent in all impudency for the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of the God of this world,</hi> (<hi>ſpoken of</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4.) to be prevailers in maintaining that ſin and diſobedience to: the law of the righteous and juſt God will remain in the beſt Saints <hi>(if they be no better then our ſelves are yet by confeſſion and practiſe)</hi> as long as they live.</p>
            <p>That being the end for which we are what we are, in all reviling and ſlandering the ſaid Doctor <hi>Drayton</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> under the horrid names of Jeſults, and Factors for <hi>Rome,</hi> (<hi>even for ſuch Saints at</hi> Rome <hi>who were moſt eminent above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in</hi> Neroe's <hi>houſe when Paul was there,</hi> Phil. 4.22.)</p>

            <p>Now if thus you do, my united brethren, I aſſure my ſelf and you (as I tell you in my laſt paragraph) that our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>(if we can overcome our enemies, though it be but by Club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, as they did,</hi> Rev. 11.17.) <hi>will be glorious among all lovers of ſinful pleaſures and profits more then lovers of God and his holineſſe: for then we may as they did,</hi> (Rev. 11.10.) <hi>rejoyce and be merry, if we can ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade weak capacities to be confident that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live, becauſe then we our ſelves ſhall ſtill be accounted for ſuch Saints among the people; and alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man whoſe teeth continuall water after the apples of</hi> Sodom, <hi>will then think his own beloved ſin (how worthy ſoever it be to be hated) is the only innate corruption and infirmity that will and muſt remain in him as long as he liveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus you ſee friends how glorious our victory is like to be (if we can prevaile) in the eyes of all Epicures and lovers of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profits and pleaſures. But indeed we do but diſſemble and lye when we ſay it will be glorious through Jeſus Chriſt: for Chriſt is not (ſaith the Apoſtle</hi> Gal. 2.17.) <hi>the Miniſter of ſin; for he came to redeem all his Saints from all iniquity,</hi> Tit, 2.14. <hi>and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him belongeth better glory for ever and ever to be given to him from ſuch as thoſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27, 28. who are ſanctified and waſhed in water by the word, then can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to him by our beſt Saints who plead to have ſin remain in them as long as they live; to which all truly enlightened Saints ſay Amen, namely, that Chriſt may have more glory from his eminent Saints by their being purged from all ſin, then can redound to him from the conſtant cleaving of ſin to them as long as they live, which is contrary to God
<pb facs="tcp:29469:6"/>and Chriſt and the holy Spirit, yea ſo contrary to the Saints pure happineſs as nothing can be more oppoſite thereunto.</p>
            <p>This is the Paraphraſe that Mr. <hi>John Tendering</hi> muſt have made himſelf of his preface, if required to explain it, as conſonant and in reference to his poſitions, that ſin and diſobedience to Gods law will remain in the beſt of Saints as long as they live; therefore we could give no other paraphraſe upon his preface <hi>(conſideratis conſiderandis)</hi> then what we have (for ſubſtance) delivered to Mr. <hi>John</hi>'s friends; whereby they may ſee his naked mind under the covert of Scripture-phraſes by which he would deceive the hearts of ſimple and well-meaning people: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we hope his friends will not ſay that we have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and wreſted his words in his preface from his own deſign. Becauſe we are perſwaded his friends will not have him ſpeak in his preface heterogeneals to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in his Vindication; for then he doth abuſe them, and make them believe that in his book to be one of his beloved truths which he doth contradict in his preface, if he mean not according to our paraphr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe, and ſo with coloured words deceiveth the hearts of his many allies which relie upon his lying oracles.</p>
            <p>Again, if men do not mean their prefaces to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively in reference to their ſubſequent deſigns, then their preface and their book will not be conſentanies, but diſparates, and the author of them a diſſentany <hi>(altornis vicibus)</hi> to them both: therefore Mr. <hi>John Tendrings</hi> friends muſt acknowledge (if he be not alwayes a jugler) that he meant this preface (though varniſhed with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-phraſes) ſhould relate (as conſentanies) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and alſo he would be found a conſentany to them both in reference to his ultimate end, namely, (to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain though he cannot do it) <hi>that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence (when he ſaith in the front of his ſalutes, <hi>To all lovers of Gods truth)</hi> we ask all unbiaſſed and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men, whether he can mean (if he intend the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his poſitions) any others but ſuch that love his
<pb facs="tcp:29469:7"/>ſinful poſitions, and love that ſin will remain in them (as Gods truth) as long as they live.</p>
            <p>When he wiſheth <hi>grace</hi> to them, what grace doth he wiſh them, but grace to keep themſelves in a ſinful life? for he ſaith, <hi>it is the Orthodox Proteſtant doctrine, that ſin will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the beſt Saints at long as they live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he wiſheth them <hi>peace,</hi> what can he wiſh, but that they may be quiet &amp; not diſturbed by endeavouring to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie all their ſinnes in this mortal life, becauſe he affirms to his friends that ſin will remain in them as long as they live?</p>
            <p>When he ſaith <hi>grace and peace through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> what can thoſe words <hi>(through Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> intend, if conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reference to his poſitions, but that he would fain have Chriſt and ſin dwell and be yoked together in him and his friends, (though it be contrary to the Apoſtles dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15.) and ſo to have peace in a way quite contrary to that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14, 15. where is hinted that the partition-wall of ſin is to be broken down; what is it but a plain mocking of Chriſt <hi>(abſit blaſphemia dicto)</hi> to call him the faithful redeemer of all his Saints, and yet he doth not (by the Vindicators doctrine) redeem them from all ſin in this life? as if Chriſt either cannot or will not redeem them from all ſins, <hi>that they may ſerve the Lord without blame, in righteouſneſs and holineſs all the dayes of their lives, Luk.</hi> 1.74 75. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>And whom can he call (in his firſt paragraph) <hi>his beloved friends</hi> (if he mind his poſitions) but ſuch as ſtick to him in maintaining that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live ? and alſo will be ready to do us all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious miſchief they can for oppoſing them in teaching the contrary truths ? for none that read his book, and have heard his ſcandalizing of us, can believe that he accounteth us and them of our mind, beloved friends.</p>
            <p>What times can he mean, when he ſaith, <hi>theſe are the times foretold &amp;c.</hi> muſt not he mean (if he will have his ſinful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions ſtill maintained) the times wherein there is a falling away from (this poſitions) &amp; a defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from believing them?</p>
            <p>Muſt not he mean (when he ſaith, <hi>as a forerunner of

            <p>Muſt not he mean (when he ſaith, <hi>there are many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets among us)</hi> ſuch as propheſie and evidence the Scripture againſt his tenents aforeſaid? wherefore they are to him and his friends like <hi>Michajah</hi> to <hi>Abah,</hi> who ſaid that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

When he calleth them <hi>men confident in an arme of fleſh:</hi> can any wiſe man who mindeth and underſtandeth his poſition, think that thoſe words can reach us; who perſwade all men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a poſſibility of mortifying all ſin in them through the grace and help of Chriſt; but that they reach only ſuch men, who like himſelf teach and maintain with bold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live, becauſe that ſin is called fleſh, as aforeſaid? And therefore to maintain ſin, as the Vindicator and his friends do, is to be confident in an arm of fleſh. And can a wiſe man believe his words do reach us, where he ſaith <hi>Goliah.</hi>-like (the great Giant againſt little <hi>David</hi>) when

               </gap>ſes againſt us. But let us have but our liberty to preach in their Pulpits our doctrines of a poſſibility of a total mortifica tion of ſin in this life through the grace and help of Chriſt, then (as the Prophet ſaid 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.24.) <hi>Let the God which anſwereth by fire, to purge away the filthineſſe of Jeruſalem by the ſpirit of judgment and burning,</hi> (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.4.) <hi>be God:</hi> and therefore if the doctrine of a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a total mortification in this life be of God, <hi>it will ſtand, Act.</hi> 15.38, 39. if not, <hi>let Baal plead for himſelf,</hi> Judg. 6.31, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; what can the Vindicator mean in the next words of his preface, <hi>of which number we have to deal with,</hi> but with them (as our ſelves do) who plead againſt <hi>Baal,</hi> and againſt the neceſſity of ſins remaining in the beſt Saints as long as they live? for that is his aſſertion in his Vindication, that ſinne will remain, as aforeſaid, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſuch as contradict his poſitions that he will deal with: for he profeſſeth that he will maintain them to the utmoſt of his little wit.</p>
            <p>What can he mean where he ſaith (in his next pargraph) <hi>he regardeth not how he is eſteemed of in this world for ingaging in this quarrel, but that he regardeth not what contrary-minded men to himſelf ſay?</hi> being reſolved to quarrel with all that do oppoſe him in his ſinful poſition (a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble buſineſſe we wiſs to quarrel for) that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live: yea to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſinns quarrel he telleth us, no applauſe from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not intend to give it him, but to blame him for his impudency, ſhall ſwell him, nor diſpraiſe (he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>from ſuch great men as he knoweth diſown his poſitions)

            <p>What truth is oppoſed by us, but his ſinful doctrine, which he calleth truth, though it come from the father of lies? for <hi>all ſin is of the devill,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>who is a lyar from the beginning;</hi> for where is there one teſtimony in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which declareth that ſin wil remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live? or one teſtimony in Scripture which evidenceth that no Saint ever died to all ſinne until he put off his mortal body? it is one thing what Saints are in this life for the moſt part, and another what the doctrine of the Sriptures doth atteſt and teach what Saints ought to be in all holy and ſpotleſſe converſation.</p>

            <p>And what can <hi>the obligation be by which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>they are bound to maintain that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live,</hi> but their ſinful profits and pleaſures; which men muſt part with (as they did <hi>Act.</hi> 9.18, 19.) if our doctrines be received? otherwiſe they muſt go no longer for any other Saints in the world but ſuch as are like <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars</hi> image, <hi>Dan,</hi> 2.32, 33.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:29469:9"/>known that ſome have lamented and condoled their want of power as yet not granted them, to chaſtiſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and hereſie (in their ſenſe,) as the Jews would do <hi>Paul</hi> for his hereſie, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14. though they confeſs that Synods and Councels may erre, and ſo do they in their late Confeſſion of Faith.</p>
            <p>What can the Vindicator mean by his words in his next paragraph, where he acknowledgeth that <hi>he is not noted the unworthieſt among the thouſands of Levites</hi> (as he ſtileth them of his mind to maintain ſin as aforeſaid;) <hi>but that he is of no ſmal eſteem</hi> (how notorious and vile ſoever his life and converſation is known and proved to be for above twenty years) <hi>among the ſaid Levites,</hi> becauſe he doth maintain his poſitions with more audaciouſneſs and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency then other Levites of his mind (though with as little ſenſe) can do.</p>

            <p>Beſides, he thinketh it ſo advantagious to plead for the continuance of ſin, that it will gain the acceptation of all that be of his mind, and have with <hi>Ahab, ſold themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:29469:9"/>wickedly</hi>) without begging their patronage: and therefore he addeth further, <hi>if he erre in the management of his</hi> ſinful buſineſs, <hi>he deſires pardon, that he cannot maintain it better;</hi> for his will is (you may ſee) to do his utmoſt to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his poſitions, though his will and abilities are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to do Satan the ſervice he deſireth to do, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live; for if men be perſwaded to believe that poſition, then the leaſt of Saints may well be quiet in their ſins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbing themſelves for what they cannot (as this Veterator ſaith) hinder and remove by the grace and help of Chriſt to boot.</p>
            <p>What can he mean when he ſaith alſo, that <hi>he deſireth not defence,</hi> but that he doth not deſire nor deſerve to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf, if he do not his utmoſt endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend (if he mind his poſition) that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints ſo long as they live?</p>

            <p>And whom can he call <hi>men of bleſſed memory,</hi> but ſuch (if he mind his poſition) who maintain (ſo deſirable is a ſinful life to him) that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live?</p>
            <p>And doth not he intend them by his <hi>reverend Clergy</hi> (in the ſaid paragraph) who preach as he doth, to maintain that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live? otherwiſe he would have honoured the late Dr. <hi>Drayton</hi> of the reverend Clergy for his pious Sermons on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
            <p>What volumes can he mean by his words in his next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, which he ſaith <hi>many are not able to buy,</hi> but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of ſuch abuſed and unwarrantable teſtimonies as he produceth to confirm his poſition with, that ſin will remain
<pb facs="tcp:29469:10"/>as aforeſaid? and becauſe they cannot be had, therefore he offers them his pamplet of non-ſenſe to delude them with who are haſty to believe him.</p>
            <p>And whom can he mean by <hi>weak capacities,</hi> but ſuch as he is afraid are not ſtoutly reſolved to ſtand to his poſitions, but that he doubts they will be drawn off (if they ſearch the Scriptures) from believing ſuch pernicious doctrine to their ſouls, as that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints ſo long as they live?</p>
            <p>What can he mean (by thoſe words in his next para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph) where he ſaith <hi>that he doth endeavour their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and confirmation;</hi> but that he deſireth to confirm ſinne to remain in them as long as they live, that ſo they may be ſatisfied with it? And therefore he ſaith, he <hi>preſent; them with ſome few collections</hi> (if he had preſented none it would have been more for his credit and comfort in the end) <hi>to perſwade them that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live;</hi> and that without diſpute, if they will take his word for it, who is moſt frequent in lying.</p>
            <p>What can he mean by thoſe words (his collections ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to be weighed and digeſted by them) but that he would have them ſo ſetled &amp; rivetted in weak capacities, as that they may never forget his tenents, <hi>that they, and the beſt Saints, muſt live in ſin while they live among men?</hi> and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions (when the enemies to his doctrine talke of mortifying all ſin in this life) they may reply, and ſay as the Lady Abbeſſe did to her wanton daughter (both juſtified by the Vindicators poſitions) <hi>By Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Daughter, ſinners are we all:</hi> for ſo this Vetera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor doth impudently maintain, that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>What can he mean (in his next paragraph) where he ſaith, <hi>I deſire to bleſſe God for what others have done;</hi> but that it is his prayer and thankſgiving to God, for ſuch men who preach up ſinne (if he mind his poſition) and maintain that it will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live? elſe he reſolveth to be none of the beſt, if any Saint at all.</p>
            <p>What can he mean by his next words (in the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph) <hi>if that which I have now done be any thing ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it hath obtained its end;</hi> but that he had no other end in his eye and thoughts in writing this pernicious Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and deſtructive to a good life, but to petſwade men to live quietly in ſinne, and not to trouble themſelves, and grieve for that they cannot help, <hi>becauſe</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>ſinne will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can he mean when he further ſaith, <hi>I am willing to ſpend and to be ſpent for the Iſrael of God;</hi> but that they are the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of his God who prevail (if he mind his poſition) againſt the grace of Chriſt, for to remain in ſinne as long as they live? for <hi>Chriſt came to redeem his Saints from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Ti.</hi> 2.14. and <hi>to purifie to himſelf a peculiar people zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works:</hi> and for whom will he ſpend and be ſpent, but for ſuch prevailers who can prevail (if he mind his tenents) againſt all gain-ſayers, that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long they live? For theſe and with theſe he will ſpend his patrimony, and all he can get beſides by his practiſe as an Emperick at large.</p>
            <p>What can he mean when he addeth further, <hi>that he will be ſpent,</hi> but that he expecteth at laſt to be ſpent in a ſinful life himſelf? for he ſaith in his Vindication, that <hi>death onely putteth an end to a ſinful life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what can be the ſenſe of thoſe words (in the ſame paragraph) <hi>that being the end for which we are what we are;</hi> but that he looketh on himſelf and thoſe of his mind and way to be appointed by ſome, let him name by whom (if he mind his poſitions) to maintain that ſin will remain in all Saints ſo long as they live? and that is the end for which he is become what he is in ſhamleſneſs to maintain that ſin
<pb facs="tcp:29469:11"/>will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live.</p>
            <p>What can he mean by thoſe words (in his next paragraph) where he ſaith to his allies and Levites, <hi>you are now upon the ſtage, fight the good fight of faith,</hi> but that (if he mind his poſition) to remain in ſin and diſobedience is the object of his faith, and that he doth underſtand Saint <hi>Jude?</hi> when he biddeth them <hi>to contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> (v. 3. of that Epiſtle) that he biddeth them contend (for ſo this Veterator doth) that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as thy live, as the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, if any do deny it and contradict the ſame?</p>

            <p>When he telleth them <hi>they are upon the ſtage,</hi> what can he mean (in reference to his poſition) but to put them in mind that they are above, and Doctor <hi>Drayton</hi> muſt ſtand below to hear thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Was there ever Veterator that abuſed Scripture-phraſe more then this one doth in a Preface that muſt relate to
<pb facs="tcp:29469:11"/>his poſitions, or elſe he himſelf overthroweth his own poſitions by his Preface? I ſay was there ever varlet abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Scripture-phraſe as this Veterator doth, when he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his <hi>Lovites</hi> fight the good fight of faith, in reference to his poſition, that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live? for they are the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. and do you think that <hi>Paul</hi> bid <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to fight (as a good fight of faith) againſt thoſe who deny that ſinne will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live?</p>
            <p>What did <hi>Paul</hi> intend by his words, when he ſaid, <hi>I have fought the good fight of faith, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, from honceforth is laid up for me the crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe?</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. I ſay, did <hi>Paul</hi> mean any of theſe words in reference to the Vindicators poſition, who bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his <hi>Levites</hi> fight the good fight of faith? which muſt be in reference to, and for his ſinful poſition, elſe he ſaith nothing to them that is to his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had been (which God forbid) of the Vindicators and his <hi>Levites</hi> mind, then if any ſhould have contradicted him, as we do the Veterator, what ſtuff had <hi>Paul (abſit blaſphemia dicto)</hi> couched under the ſaid words, if thus or in a like manner, they had been explained in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Vindicators poſition; O you who deny that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live, <hi>I have fought the good fight of faith,</hi> (as the Veterator ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth his Levites to do) againſt ſuch as deny that ſin will remain in me as long as I live: I have finiſhed my courſe in ſin, to be in me as long as I live; I have kept the faith or belief of the doctrine, that ſin will remain in me (and in all Saints) as long as I live; from hence (for ſo beleeving my continuing in ſin, and contending for it as truth, like as this Vindicator doth) is laid up for me the crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, for contending for an unrighteous life? As if it were a righteous work to contend for ſinne (if any deny it) to remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live; which is the thing this Veterator aimeth at.</p>
            <p>What can the Vindicat or mean by theſe words (in his
<pb facs="tcp:29469:12"/>laſt paragraph) where he ſaith, <hi>I aſſure my ſelf and you that our victory ſhall be glorious,</hi> but that he doth count it a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (if he mind his poſition) that ſin will remain in him and his friends as long as they live? though the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. of ſuch, <hi>their glory is their ſhame, that mind earthly things:</hi> and what more earthly then ſin? according to that <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.4.</p>
            <p>What can he mean when he ſaith, <hi>it ſhall be glorious through Chriſt,</hi> but that he would perſwade them that Chriſt will (if he mind his poſition) countenance and honour them for contending that ſinne will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live? Yea, when he ſaith <hi>glorious through Chriſt,</hi> what can he mean but that he would perſwade them that Chriſt will plead alſo for ſin to remain in his beſt Saints as long as they live? by reaſon that to ſay their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ſhall be glorious through Jeſus Chriſt, is to make them believe that Chriſt will own ſinne to be there (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his poſitions) by his concurrence and aſſiſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides allowance; for then its through Jeſus Chriſt, when he is a partial, chief, procreant and conſervant cauſe of it: whereas indeed the Apoſtle ſaith the contrary, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>What fellowſhip is there betwixt Chriſt and Belial, betwixt righteouſneſſe and unrightcouſneſſe?</hi> wherefore God ſaith to his Saints, <hi>come out from among them, and touch no unclean thing, and then I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can he mean by thoſe words (in his laſt paragraph) <hi>to whom be glory,</hi> but that he and his friends (if his poſitions be minded) think they ought to give glory to Chriſt for ſuch doctrines, that ſinne will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live?</p>
            <p>And his adding of <hi>Amen</hi> as in reference to Chriſt (in the cloſe of all he ſaith) can argue no other thing, but that he <hi>hopeth, wiſheth, and prayeth,</hi> (if he remember his poſition) <hi>that it may be ſo granted</hi> from Chriſt that ſin may remain in himſelf, and his friends and in as many as he can perſwade to believe him, as long as they live? for the word <hi>Amen</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies as much and more of that kind then we have atteſted it to compreheud.</p>

            <p>Beſides, the ſubſtance of his preface is a condolement of ſad times coming on, and of falſe prophets riſen up; and muſt not that relate to his poſitions? ſo that he muſt count them the falſe prophets which he crieth out againſt, for teaching a poſſibility of a total mortification of ſin (through the help of Chriſt) in this life; otherwiſe himſelf and his ſpecified Levites muſt be the falſe prophets, for maintaining that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live. And the ſad times muſt be the times wherein there is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from his poſitions, and from them who ſtand and plead as he and his fellow-Levites do, that ſin will remain, &amp;c. maugre the grace of Chriſt inclining to the contrary. Secondly, his arguments laid down in his preface to his friends and Levites, alſo his exhortations to them, and prayers for them, do all ſhew that the expreſſes in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face muſt be ſo explained as we have done in reference to his poſitions.</p>
            <p>And therefore if he or his friends do underſtand that all things in a preface and a book ought to look towards one another as face anſwers to face, for to juſtifie and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain each other, then they will acknowledge that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and book muſt in like manner reflect upon each other; and ſo be forced to yield (upon this account) that our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe hath expreſſed (though not fully) the genuine (though miſchievous) intent of his preface reſpectively conſidered.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator doth ſubſcribe himſelf an obedient Son of the Church; but he doth not tell us of what Charch: yet let any diſingaged perſon to his principles confider his poſitions fronted in his Vindication, and he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity bear teſtimony (if he be deſired) that he is an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Son onely of the malignant Church of Satan; for <hi>he

               <p>But firſt, let us take a view of the poſitions themſelves; the firſt of which is this, as he hath ſtared it, [That ſin will have a being in the beſt of men, ſo long as their ſouls have a being in the houſes of clay.] Whence theſe abſurdities will follow; Firſt, that ſin comes originally from <hi>Jehovah,</hi> in that it is ſaid to have a being; for nothing is ſaid to have a being of eſſence, or exiſtence but what firſt comes from the Being of beings, <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelfe. Secondly, he here makes ſin to be a ſupreme, if not an almighty commander, in that he ſaith ſin will have ſuch a being. Thirdly, herein he makes little difference between grown men, and babes in Chriſt; for ſin, ſaith he, will have a being in the beſt of them till death. Fourthly, he doth not here exempt Chriſt himſelfe as he was man. Fifthly, he makes our bodies or houſes of clay, to be the proper domicil and ſeat of ſin: and then neither <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, nor Chriſt as man, were free from ſin, for both dwelt originally in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of clay.</p>
               <p>The ſecond poſition is this; [That no man can by grace in this life perform ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God, as not to offend againſt the ſame, or to be thereby juſtified, otherwiſe then by Chriſt of Orace given.] From whence you may obſerve theſe things likewiſe; Firſt, that this man whoſe name <hi>Iohn</hi> imports the grace of God, is called ſo <hi>per Antiphraſin;</hi> for he is an enemy to, and with <hi>Herod,</hi> an impriſoner of the grace of God. Secondly, he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions not what men do <hi>de facto,</hi> but what men can do in this life with the utmoſt helpe of grace. Thirdly, he makes the Law ſimply unlawfull, becauſe it is impoſſible, as he ſaith, to obſerve it, both to nature and grace. Fourthly, he doth not here reſerve a place of poſſibility for Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29469:14"/>as man to fulfill it. Fifthly, it appears here that the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> is a great lover of forbidden fruit; for whereas Doctor <hi>Drayton</hi> told him at the firſt that he would not in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie have any thing to do with the worke of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this man will needs bring in that by hook or by crook. Sixthly, that he is yet caught in the ſame ſnare which he laid for another; for he tacitly ſaith, that we cannot be juſtified by ſuch a perfect obedience to the Law of God, otherwiſe then by Chriſt of grace given; and ſo ſay we: yea, if he grants us this, he yields the other queſtion alſo; for he that can be juſtified by ſuch a fulfilling of the Law through the grace of Chriſt, hath no ſin unſubdued left in him. And if he runs into ſo many abſurdities as he lancheth forth, what will he doe when he comes into the maine?</p>
               <p>His firſt and grand impertinency is this, that he ſpends the firſt ten pages in a Common-place about ſin, wherein he is ſo intangled that he can ſcarcely find the way out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; of which take this ſhort account:</p>
               <p>Pag. 1. He tells us [that to the intent his enſuing diſcourſe may be proper &amp; profitable for the informing of the weak, &amp; eſtabliſhing them in the faith of the truth, which next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the glory of God (which is not much glorified by our continuance in ſin, which is that he pleads for;) and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the truth, (which he directly here repreſſeth,) is the onely thing here by him intended, he ſhal obſerve this method there following.] But ere we come to that, what difference is there betwixt the eſtabliſhment of men in the faith of the truth, &amp; the advancement of the truth; which he makes two diſtinct things? But what is his intended me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod? Firſt, ſaith he, I ſhall define what ſin is in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; which he may the better doe becauſe of his long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with it, which by his calculation of his age was twenty foure yeares before his Mother bare him, and perhaps ſome years before her birth alſo. Secondly, he will ſhew what the firſt ſin was. Thirdly, what were the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it. Fourthly, the effects of it: (Thus he loves ſtill to ramble about from his right ſtation.) And laſtly, what ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin is. But what difference is there between the firſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29469:15"/>ſin, and original ſin, which here he makes two things? He tells us here alſo, that the Hebrew word tranſlated <hi>ſin</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies properly miſdoing, or miſſing of the marke, as if the Hebrews had not many words to denote ſin, though he can name none of them. This learned Linguiſt tels us page 26. that the Apoſtle doth uſually diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>peccatum</hi> and <hi>crimen,</hi> as if the Apoſtles writ unto the Churches in Latine. Pag. 66. he ſhews alſo what a Logician he is, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the efficient and formall cauſes of juſtification to be paſſive as well as active: And page 48 in his differencing of <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> and <hi>gratia gratum faciens,</hi> you will find him as excellent a Schoolman, or ſchoolboy rather.</p>
               <p>Page 2. he ſaith, that in Religion the Law is our marke or way from which if we ſwerve we ſin. But is not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel our way therein alſo? and that in a ſpeciall manner of our Chriſtian Faith and Religion? That defect is the general nature of ſin; but is not exceſs, which is the other extreme ſinfull alſo? That this defect is an inclination or action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Law; But what thinks he of evill words, as falſe accuſation, lying, curſing, and ſwearing, (ſuch as he frequently uſeth,) are not they ſinfull alſo?</p>
               <p>[That there is in ſin a double formality, repugnancy to the Law, and guilt. But guilt] is the effect, and not the form of ſin.</p>
               <p>[That the former of theſe two is a compariſon with the Law,] but it is a diſpariſon or diſſimilitude therewith [that the firſt fin of man was the diſobedience of our firſt Parents in eating the forbidden fruit.] But if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it of their actuall eating of that fruit, he is much miſtaken; for as the womans actual eating thereof did go before the mans, ſo many gradual evils did precede them both; as firſt, diffidence &amp; incredulitie to Gods word, who had expreſly ſaid, <hi>in the day that thou ſhalt eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, dying thou ſhalt dye.</hi> Secondly, too much eare and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given to the devils lying promiſe, who ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall not die, but be as gods, knowing good and evill.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the too much liking and approbation of the forbidden fruit. Fourthly, the hungring or thirſting after it. Fifthly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29469:15"/>contempt of Gods juſtice. Sixthly, ingratitude towards him for all his former goodneſſe. And laſtly, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to Satan, and reſolution to eat of that fruit.</p>
               <p>[That in the generall, all our corruption and miſery is ſprung from that firſt ſin of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>] Contrary to what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thy ſelfe, but in me is thine helpe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here he ſaith more particularly, that eternall death came upon all their poſterity by that firſt ſin. Contrary to Gods expreſs Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.16. where God will not have the ſon to ſuffer a temporall death, and much leſſe an eternal, for the fathers ſin; and directly contrary to Gods oath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.3, 4. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, ye ſhall not have occaſion any more to uſe this proverb in Iſrael. Behold, all ſouls are mine, as the ſoul of the father, ſo the ſoul of the ſon is mine: the ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> So ver. 20. <hi>The ſon ſhall not be are the iniquity of the father, neither ſhall the father bear the iniquity of the ſon; the righteouſneſs of the righteous ſhall be upon him, and the wickedneſſe of the wicked ſhall be upon him.</hi> Num. 16.22. <hi>Shall one man ſin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the Congregation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[That the corruption &amp; averſneſſe of our nature came from that fall aforeſaid, Pag, 3. that all our actuall ſins doe ſpring from thence.] See to the contrary, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. [That the firſt ſin of man is the cauſe of all other ſins and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which is true of each mans perſonal fall and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and not of the other.]</p>
               <p>[That the Spirit by the Law entitles us to <hi>Adams</hi> ſin. He means the firſt <hi>Adams,</hi> as a derivation from the root to the branches; as poyſon is carried from the fountain to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern; and as the children of traitors have their blood tainted with the treaſon of their fathers; and as the children of bondſlaves are under their parents conditions. But all theſe ſimilitudes are but ſhaws to catch woodcocks; for neither was the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> either the root or fountain of our ſoules, which are Gods immediate workmanſhip, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.16. <hi>for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made:</hi> nor are our bodies unclean by birth, being created to be

To all which we will give anſwer in the order ſet down with what brevity we can, having anſwered the ſame at large in our <hi>Examen.</hi> As for that <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Whatſoever is born of the fleſh is fleſh;</hi> it is true of the wiſedome of the fleſh, and of the righteouſneſſe of the fleſh, as well as of the open ſin; but Chriſt ſpeaks not here of the naturall birth of men, but of a ſpiritual, be it true or falſe. As for <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 13, 20. the Apoſtle ſpeaks there thus; <hi>Therefore as by one man ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, and death by ſin; ſo death went over all men,</hi>

But not as the offence ſo is the free gift; for the judgment was of one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto juſtification: for if by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive an abundance of grace and of the gift of Righteouſneſſe, ſhall reign in life by one, Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore as by the offence of one judgement came upon all to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one the free gift came upon all men to the juſtification of life: for as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Unto which long Text
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29469:16"/>we give this ſhort anſwer; Firſt, that it is a parallel and oppoſition betwixt <hi>Adams</hi> miſchief and Chriſts remedy and cure, but few in theſe days of ſuppoſed (rather then true) light, underſtand either the one or the other aright; for beſides the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> or man, whom the Vindicator with many more, for want of a true Judicator, here underſtands, there are foure <hi>Adams</hi> mentioned both in the Scriptures and other writers. The firſt is our natural or earthly man, which is the creature of this world; of whom our Apoſtle ſaith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 41. <hi>The firſt man is of the earth earthly.</hi> The ſecond is an inward portraiture of righteouſneſſe, a glimpſe of the heavenly man, yet earthy, naturall and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; which we all beare at the firſt, and ſo are ſaid <hi>to have born the image of the earthly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49.

               <p>That we were all in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> legally; No, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally onely.</p>
               <p>That there was a ſtipulation and Covenant between God and <hi>Adam</hi> for all mankind. That we were all parties with him to any ſuch Covenant.</p>
               <p>That we were liable to the curſe that belongeth to the breach of that Covenant.] All which are the meer figments of mans brain.</p>
               <p>That we had intereſt in the mercy promiſed in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Covenant.] Of all which there is no footſtep to be found in the word.</p>
               <p>That being in him naturally we were unavoidably ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to all the bondage and burthen which he or the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature then contracted.] Not ſo, unleſs it were ſome temporal calamity, with which God might juſtly plague his poſterity for his fall and ſins. Yet he goes on in page 4. to prove that we are guilty of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, but by falſe principles, or with true principles miſapplied, as followeth.</p>
               <p>That every thing which is born carrieth with it the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that which did bear it, as touching the ſubſtance and accidents proper to the ſpecial kind.</p>
               <p>This is a truth, and therefore the ſoul which is born and breathed from God muſt needs be pure; and the natural earthly man muſt needs be good in his kind, as all other natural living creatures are: that which is born of the Spirit in a way of regeneration is Spirit, but what is born of the Fleſh is ſtill Fleſh, as this mans Wiſdome and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, of which birth Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. as before.</p>
               <p>That we being all born of corrupt and guilty parents, do in our birth by nature draw their corruption and guilt.] Which is falſe, for guilt and corruption are not natural, but ſpiritual and adventitious things as is aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>That by the death of Chriſt who is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:29469:18"/>(howbeit not as he was man, but as he is <hi>a quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Lord from heaven,</hi>) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45, 47. we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a double grace, of Juſtification and Regeneration.] Wherein are two falſe grounds layed down; Firſt, that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and regeneration are two diſtinct things, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes but one and the ſelf ſame thing, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>But after that the kindneſs and love of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour toward man appeared, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed abundantly on us through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, that being juſtified by his grace we ſhould be made heires according to the hope of eternal life.</hi> And 1 Cor. 6.11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> The ſecond falſe ground is, that we receive thoſe two gifts of juſtification and regeneration by the death of Chriſt; for though remiſſion of ſins is purchaſed thereby for the true beleevers, yet that is neither regeneration nor juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the Apoſtles ſenſe, nor is juſtification purchaſed thereby; for he that made us had power to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate without any ſuch purchaſe: That therefore it follows, that out of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> (to wit our firſt parent) there iſſued a double evil unto and upon us, to wit, guilt and corruption, we deny as falſe and inconſequent.</p>
               <p>That in this derivative the ſin which he ſpeaks of is an univerſal corruption, is falſe likewiſe, in which are two great evils, as he ſaith: <hi>Sed ſublato ſub, ecto tollitur ad unctum.</hi>

               <p>[That this pretended derivative ſin to be ſo conveyed from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to us is an inherent deordination, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil diſpoſition, diſeaſe, propenſion to all miſchief, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy and averſation to all good, which the Scripture calls the <hi>fleſh, the wiſdome of the fleſh, the body of ſin, earthly members, the works of the Devil, the Hell that ſets the whole courſe of nature on fire, Jam.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8.] Unto which I ſay, that although all thoſe names are juſtly given to the body of ſin, eſpecially when it is fully formed in men with all his members; yet firſt, there is no ſuch thing found in children, of whom our Saviour ſaith, <hi>that the Kingdome of Heaven is of ſuch;</hi> and that <hi>unleſſe we be born again</hi> after our fall and corruption, and become like them in humility, righteouſneſſe, love and meekneſſe, <hi>we cannot enter into the Kingdome of God, Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.14, 15.

               <p>But that which follows there, that no man can be more ſenſible of the through-malignity of this derivative corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then <hi>Paul</hi> was when he cryed out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Is, firſt, the old miſtake, and afterwards backed with this errour and peice of nonſenſe, untill his underſtanding was opened to conceive the ſpiritualneſs, penetration and compaſs of the holy Law, which meaſures the very bottome of every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:

               <p>That the Law condemns as well the original as the Acts of ſin, is true of prohibition, but not of condemnation; for each ſinful motion is by the Law diſcovered and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; but we are not condemned for the ſame till we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or like of the temptation in ſome meaſure.</p>
               <p>Thoſe enſuing poſitions are alſo falſe; Firſt, that <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 5.14. underſtands by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and him that was the Lawgiver; but two diſtinct eſtates in men, as was ſaid before: which may appear out of the foregoing verſe compared with this; <hi>For untill the Law ſin was in the world,</hi> that is, before the inward <hi>Moſes,</hi> Lawgiver or reprover cometh unto men; <hi>but where there is no Law ſin is not reputed for ſin,</hi> for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>That the men who ſinned between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s age and the time of <hi>Moſes, did not ſin after the ſimilitude of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams tranſgreſſion,</hi> againſt the clear revelation of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will, as <hi>Adam</hi> did.] Yet they did, for the ſame God that did forbid the eating of the forbidden fruit, doth ever ſince prohibit and forbid every ſin in every mans ſoul that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moral Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Which ſhews the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conſciences bearing them witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one another.</hi> Was not <hi>Enoch</hi> a Prophet in his time? ſee <hi>Jude</hi> 1.14. and was not <hi>Noah the eight preacher of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi> as the Apoſtle calls him 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. were not the men of the old World deſtroyed for their known wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhut into the infernal priſon for their apparent diſobedience? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. ſo that the Vindicators miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion of this place of mens ſinning for want of ſuch light as <hi>Adam</hi> had, is full of darkneſs.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29469:20"/>me leave here to obſerve two things more upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. Firſt, that thoſe perſons are ſaid here <hi>not to ſin in Adams fall,</hi> but rather if they had ſinned that <hi>it was after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion;</hi> where the Apoſtle had fair occaſion to ſpeak of our guilt and fall through that ſin, if he had known any ſuch thing. Secondly, that Chriſt is yet to come, even to the beleevers, namely Chriſt as he is <hi>the ſecond Adam, and the Lord from Heaven:</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36, 37. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.21, 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, but untruly, pag. 6. that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> and the luſt which he contracted did reign over all men from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to that <hi>Moſes</hi> the Lawgiver; ſo he means.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that not onely all men, but every part of man is ſhut up under the guilt of that firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin: (what infants? Chriſt and all?)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Apoſtle proves this at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9, 19, 23. But what are thoſe words to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe which he produceth there? to wit, <hi>what then? are we better then they? no in no wiſe:</hi> for we have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that both Jewes and Gentiles are all under ſin. But I ſay, firſt, that the Apoſtle here doth not go about to prove that the infants of either are ſo. Secondly, that this is not corruption deſcended from our firſt parents fall, but contracted by our own fall and diſobedience. But he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on with the Apoſtles words, ver. 19. <hi>Now we know that what things ſoever the Law ſaith it ſaith it to them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> verſ. 23. <hi>For all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God:</hi> and Rom. 11.32. <hi>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> But doth the Law ſpeak any ſuch thing to or of infants? No, we have ſhewed the contrary out of <hi>Geneſis</hi> 9.6. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.9. before quoted: to which adde <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.24, 25. and the parable of the Talents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and that of the loſt groat, or peece of ſilver; and that of the prodigal Son, who had a portion to ſpend, which he afterwards
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29469:20"/>waſted, as the ſaid woman alſo had a peice of ſilver before ſhe loſt it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. All which prove that by creation ſtill we have a talent, a meaſure, and a portion of innocency and righteouſneſs born with us.</p>
               <p>After the univerſality of perſons he goeth about to prove that ſin defileth all the parts of man: which is true when men open a free paſſage and entrance unto the Devil, which all men do not. But the Scriptures which he cites, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. and 8.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. do not fully prove it as he ſaith they do: but none of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and defilements which he enumerates there and in the ſeventh page, were drawn down from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to us.</p>
               <p>[That the whole frame of a mans heart is evil continually: and pag. 7. he ſaith that our ſin cleaves as cloſe to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as blackneſs to the skin of an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> which cannot poſſibly be waſhed off.] Then Gods promiſes made <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. and elſewhere, <hi>that he will pour clean water upon us, and cleanſe us from all our filthineſs and abominations,</hi> are to no purpoſe; and Chriſts deſign, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. is fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>[That it is an evil ever preſent with us:] Indeed the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. of himſelf and others, that were then or had been babes in Chriſt, that, <hi>when I would do good evil is preſent with me;</hi> that is too uſually, but not alwayes; for at length <hi>he knew nothing by himſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. and the <hi>Devil is at length caſt out quite by thoſe that wanre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> Rev. 12.10. yea he is ofttime made to flee away: in the mean time, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> But he goeth on, and ſaith [pag. 8.

               <p>But he goes on and ſaith, [Who would have expected or feared Adultery from ſuch a man as <hi>David,</hi> after ſo much communion with God? or impatience from <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> after ſuch revelations from God? or Idolatrie from <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> after ſo much wiſdome from God? or fretfulneſs or frowardneſs of ſpirit from <hi>Jonah,</hi> after ſuch delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from God? or fearfulneſs in <hi>Abraham,</hi> after ſo much protection from God? or curſing from <hi>Job,</hi> after ſo much patience and experience from God?] yea, by the Vindicators doctrine we might have expected all theſe, and all other ſins from any of theſe, becauſe he ſaith that every man by original ſin derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> (and which is not wholly to be ſubdued in this life) hath the ſeeds of all ſins in him. But what if they had been as innocent as <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall? might they not have been tempted as he was, and overcome likewiſe for want of cloſe depending upon God? yet behold how this Champion of corruption, to maintain his falſe doctrine, doth falſly and reproachfully charge ſome of the moſt eminent Saints with ſin, where the Lord himſelf doth not; for <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> might and did curſe their nativity in ſin, and not their firſt birth, as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29469:22"/>ſome of the beſt Expoſitors ſpeak, and that without ſin, yea with a great deal of piety towards God. Nor are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets charged with impatience by the Lord himſelf, but commended as a pattern of patience to us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.10. and <hi>Abrahams</hi> concealing of his wife (if he failed therein, which may juſtly be queſtioned) it is not ſo bad as to leave his wife and child twelve or thirteen years together; nor did he uſe lying, or ſpeaking of falſhood to help himſelf, as this falſe ſon of <hi>Abraham</hi> doth. Howbeit he concludes with a good prayer, wiſhing [that we may all learn to know our ſelves:] to which we ſay Amen. But whereas each of the eleven Apoſtles ſaid, <hi>Maſter is it I?</hi> this clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves, not that they ſuſpected themſelves, as he would have it, but that they were not conſcious to themſelves of any ſuch wicked intention or inclination. Therefore his paraphraſe here is rather <hi>humanum commentum,</hi> then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that Text: nor do all theſe inſtances prove any thing, but that men are liable, at leaſtwiſe for a time, to all manner of temptations; and that ſome in their infancy of grace may through humane infirmity be overcome by that temptation, which when they grow ſtrong in Chriſt, they can eaſily by his grace and help overcome after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; as <hi>Peter</hi> did his fear of death for Chriſts cauſe, when he ſuffered martyrdome for him: but this proves not that we muſt be alwayes babes, and like reeds ſhaken with every wind of temptation; yet ſhould our former weakneſs and falings teach us to commiſerate others, who yet through ignorance or infirmity ſometime ſtumble and fall.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is falſe which he there by way of concluſion ſpeaketh pag. 10. That ſtrive we what we can our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities will incompaſs us, and our corruption will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us ſo long as we carry fleſh about us, as we may ſee in the forenamed inſtances: [for <hi>Job</hi> and others ſaw God face to face afterwards, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2. as did <hi>Abraham, Joh.</hi> 8.5, 6. and <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 34.10.

               <p>Firſt, that it might fall into ill, God forſaking it] So it doth; but we forſake him firſt. That God did not confirm the firſt man againſt the fall, yet he did by his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, warning, and threatning:] And ſo he doth ſtill; but he never did, nor ever will confirm any man by force againſt his will.</p>
               <p>That he permitteth the firſt man to be ſeduced, and to fall into ſin and death, that as many as were ſaved out of the common ruine might be ſaved by mercy alone.] But the common ruine is ours by perſonal fall, and not by our firſt parents, as we have ſhewed.</p>
               <p>That if in the world there had been no miſery there had been no mercy;] Yea <hi>Gods mercy is over all his works, Pſalm</hi> 115.9. yea his mercy is from everlaſting.] We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it is true; for the object of mercy is a miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and there had been goodneſſe and bounty to man if he had not ſinned.</p>
               <p>That if there had been no miſery there had been no need of Chriſt.] Yea, both to create and to preſerve that which is created, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>That if there been no ſin, there had been no matter to ſhew his juſtice:] Yes, there is juſtice in rewarding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, as well as in puniſhing the diſobedient; as we ſee in rewarding of the good and bad Angels.</p>
               <p>Pag 20. by miſcount] That ſin, or the fall, is neceſſary in regard of Gods decree:] Why did that neceſſitate man to ſin? then God muſt be the firſt author of ſin.</p>

               <p>That man at his firſt creation had not power to will what he would do.] Yes, he had that power ſo to will, but was not forced thereunto, nor, being created a free agent, ought he to be forced to chooſe this or that.</p>

[<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.28. <hi>that a corrupt tree can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth good fruit.</hi>] Yea, if it be corrupt but in part: as all men after the fall are but in part, and by degrees cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt at the firſt, and for ſome time afterwards; nor in all things at once, but ſpecifically in one evil after another, and gradually in each. As for <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. we ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what that imports: and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>We are not able of our ſelves to think,</hi> [imagine, or conceive] <hi>any thing as of our ſelves,</hi> to wit, in ſpiritual and heavenly myſteries, which muſt only be made known by revelation, as they were to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.3, 4 5.</p>
               <p>That we have no liberty and proneneſſe of will to do that which is good.] Is there then no difference between willing and doing, liberty and proneneſſe, proneneſſe and power?</p>
               <p>That by nature we have no love of God, nor readineſſe to obey him.] But by creation, and the word ingrafted, we have both before our fall; otherwiſe how can we ſeek God, which is the great end of our creation? <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26, 27. <hi>That they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if happily they might feele after him.</hi> Or why doth the Lord expect any ſuch thing from the ſons of men, if they have no faculty or ability to doe it? <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 14.2. <hi>The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there was any that did underſtand and ſeek after God.</hi>

               <p>[Pag. 22. by the firſt miſcount, he denyeth that God doth enable the will of it ſelfe to do good works if it pleaſe.] But to will is one thing, and really to do good is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and requires a further power. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>To will is

               </p>
               <p>He ſaith alſo that Grace worketh in the will to pleaſe or chooſe;] Which is falſe, for if it determine or force the will it were not a free agent: <hi>voluntas trahitur, non cogitur,</hi> the will may be drawn, but not forced.</p>
               <p>That God doth not hang his work upon the ſuſpended Ifs of our wils.] This is altogether againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95.7, 8. <hi>If this day ye will heare his voice, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hearts as in the provocation:</hi> or <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient ye ſhall cat the good of the Land, but if ye refuſe and be rebellious ye ſhall be devoured with the ſword:</hi> or <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Behold therefore the ſeverity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God; on them which fell ſeverity, but toward thee good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if thou continue in his goodneſſe, otherwiſe thou ſhalt be caſt off.</hi> But he cites <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.17. to prove it, where the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgements and doe them.</hi> To which we ſay, that this is a full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablement to keep Gods Law, even in this life, contrary to his ſecond poſition: <hi>yet will the Lord be ſought unto for this to doe it for them.</hi> ver. 31 of that chap. He cites alſo the words of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but againſt his ſecond poſition likewiſe, ſaying, <hi>we will indeed, but God worketh in us to will;</hi> that is, generally and habitually, but not in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> by a particular determination to this or that act: and ſo are <hi>Pauls</hi> words to be underſtood, not of our habitual doing, yet of our willing, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you not only to will but doe, of his good pleaſure:</hi> for otherwiſe this verſe ſhould contradict the former in ſome ſort, where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle chargeth us <hi>to work out our own ſalvation with feare and trembling;</hi> if we muſt be meerly paſſive in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, why doth he lay ſuch a charge of working or co-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us, yea of working out our ſalvation to the end?</p>
               <p>[That the will is effectually moved to doe according to the new inclination which God hath put into the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will and affections.] True, but this is done by motion, motive, or perſwaſion, not by determinating the will:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29469:25"/>For thoſe Scriptures which he cites page 23 by miſcount, prove not any more then what we grant: <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.6. <hi>The Lord will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed:</hi> for that is only to remove the foreſkin of the evill inclinations. <hi>Eze.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give:</hi> that is, new inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with an habituall power to chooſe, and an actuall power (when it is ſought) to do good. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. <hi>The Lord opened the heart of Lydia;</hi> that is, her underſtanding. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty;</hi> to wit, according to the meaſure, and working of that Spirit, which firſt opens the underſtanding, then puts incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into the will and affections, and laſtly, giveth power.</p>
               <p>Page 23. he ſaith, that in this life the renewing of our nature is not perfectly done here as concerning our knowledge of God, or our inclinations to obey him.] But untruly; for relatively to what the Law requireth of us here, we know that it is only <hi>to love God above all, and our neighbour as our ſelves, Mat.</hi> 23.37, 38, 39, 40. which we may both know and doe alſo by grace in this life, as there it is made known, and power is promiſed to act according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.18. <hi>And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhouldſt keep all his commandements:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. which he lately cited; <hi>And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, that thou mayſt live:</hi> but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to the world to come; we grant it as we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that neither our knowledge, nor our inclination, nor yet our power, ſhall be ſo intenſively full and great in this life as in the world to come.</p>
               <p>That the regenerate are not always ruled by the holy Spirit, but are ſometimes forſaken of God, either to try them, that is, to make their own weakneſs without God known unto them, as he did to <hi>Peter;</hi> or to chaſtiſe and humble them.] This is true, if we underſtand it of the whole proceſs of regeneration, but not of their finall eſtate, to which they doe or may attain by grace in this life; for Chriſt tels his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.16. <hi>that he will pray unto
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29469:26"/>the Father for them, and he ſhall ſend another comforter unto them,</hi> (which certainly is the holy Ghoſt,) <hi>and he</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall abide with you for ever.</hi> And thoſe Scriptures which he produceth prove nothing to the contrary: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11. <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me;</hi> for that ſpirit was for a time withdrawn from him, for his great fall into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and murder. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.17. <hi>Lord why haſt thou made us to erre from thy way, and hardned our heart from thy fear? return for thy ſervants ſake, the tribe of thine inheritance:</hi> Where the Prophet in the name of the young Saints, and not in his own bebalfe, complains of an hardneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by their own ſinnes; as ſee 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.57. <hi>The Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers, let him not leave us nor forſake us:</hi> it ſeemeth to witneſſe againſt him that God did not leave or forſake their fathers.</p>
               <p>His concluſion from hence [that the regenerate in this life doe always goe forward or backward, and doe not at any time ſtand ſtill, or continue in the ſame eſtate] is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true, nor conſequent from the premiſſes. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.13. <hi>For he is an unwiſe ſon, otherwiſe he ſhould not ſtay long in the place of the breaking forth of children:</hi> did not the pillar of fire and the Arke often ſtand ſtill, at which time <hi>Jſrael</hi> was not to move?</p>
               <p>Page 24 by the ſame miſcount, That the righteouſneſs of the regenerate in this life is not ſuch as may ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God:] Contrary to many Scriptures; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.1. <hi>The wicked flee when no man purſueth, but the righteous is bold as a Lion.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 22. <hi>And now little children abide in him, that when he ſhall appear we may have confidence, and not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before him at his coming.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you, for he that doth righteouſneſſe is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as he is righteous.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſſe in the day of judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he is ſo are we in this preſent world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That thoſe who are converted can no further retain good inclinations, thoughts, affections or purpoſes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere or goe forward therein, then as the Holy Ghoſt worketh and preſerveth theſe in them.] This is not true;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29469:26"/>for the Holy Ghoſt doth in time beget not only inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but habits in the underſtanding, memory, will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: ſometimes they need (indeed) the Spirits admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory and excitant grace, eſpecially in time of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not always, either then or at other times. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14, 15. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That thoſe Saints at Rome have no need of an outward admoniſher or remembrancer at all times:</hi> and the ſame may be concluded of an inward commonefaction.</p>
               <p>Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> charge <hi>Timothy to ſtir up the gift that was already in him?</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. And Chriſt himſelfe gives the like charge, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.25. <hi>that which ye have already hold faſt till I come.</hi>

               <p>Further he ſaith, [that if the Spirit of God withdraw it ſelfe, the regenerate are blind, and wander, and ſlip and fall, yet ſo as they periſh not.] He ſpeaks very favourably of wanderers, if ſo be that they were ever truly converted: but as the former part of his aſſertion is not true as to their blinding, unleſs the Spirit of God wholly deſert men; ſo the latter part is falſe, for ſome true converts may by their own default fall totally and finally, and periſh; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 8. <hi>for the juſt ſhall live by faith; but if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.12. <hi>Having damnation becauſe they have caſt off their firſt faith.</hi> Nor do the Scriptures to which he refers us ratifie what he ſaith; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> I ſay unto him again, what haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that thou doſt bring this and all other Scriptures which are ſilent to the point in hand? But 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. ſeemeth to plead for him, where the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>God ſhall confirme you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Chriſt:</hi> and Phil. 1.6. <hi>Alſo being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it till the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But we anſwer, that God indeed is conſtant on his part, and will carry on the work which he hath begun, if we prove not inconſtant in our belief, love and obedience to him; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. <hi>goodneſs towards thee if thou continue in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29469:27"/>his goodneſs, otherwiſe thou ſhalt be cut off:</hi> and Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, continue ye in my love: if ye obey my commandement sye ſhall abide in my love, as I have kept my Fathers commandements and abide in his love.</hi> So muſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. which he hath cited, be underſtood; <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit:</hi> and Phil. 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of his good pleaſure:</hi> and 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>Who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what ye are able, but will with the temptation make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it:</hi> and that of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. remaineth true notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>that ye are kept by the power of God through faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation ready to be revealed in the laſt time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 25. he ſaith, (but he ſaith without any ground of truth,) that the four-fold liberty of the will, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the four-fold eſtate of man before and after the fall, in regeneration and glory, may ſerve for one ground to confirme the point in hand.] That ſin will have a being in the beſt of men while they are here, is falſe alſo; and no leſs then theſe which follow.</p>
               <p>That the regenerate eſtate of man is here but begun, and not to be perfected.] Clean contrary to the Scriptures even now by him cited, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>That the eſtate of the regenerate here is but a growing in grace, and a perfecting more and more, and a prevailing in mortifying their corruptions; but not attaining in this mortal life to have grace conſummate, nor corruption abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but ſin remaines, and will remain, till they lay down the body, and be completely ſanctified in glory.] But is not this <hi>principium petere,</hi> to beg a principle? or <hi>idem per idem probare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after a promiſe to confirme his poſition further by Scriptures, Fathers, and reaſons, he goes on and tells us out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. That the Apoſtle there doth not ſay that there is no ſin in them that are in Chriſt, but that there is no condemnation; yet he tels us in the latter end of the ſame verſe that ſuch as are in Chriſt, who are truly incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29469:27"/>firſt into his death, and then into the ſimilitude of his reſurrection, that they have no ſin in them for they walke not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit; that <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth here that ſin was not able to condemn him, though it was in him, as he had confeſſed in the former chapter, that <hi>the evil that he would not that he did, and that he ſaw a Law in the members rebelling againſt the Law of his mind:</hi> But this ſin will condemn any man where it remaineth, as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>that the wages of ſin is death,</hi> and that of corruption. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. that <hi>ye put off the old man which is corrupting</hi> (or deſtroying) <hi>with its deceitful luſts:</hi> for ſo the beſt Tranſlators read the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, it being the Apoſtles argument why he would have the old man put off.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, that here he expects <hi>Cajetan</hi>'s or <hi>Aquinas</hi> his falſe expoſition: (and he ſhall have it, to do him a pleaſure, out of his own book, pag. 23. by the former account: <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan,</hi> one of their own fraternity ſaith, <hi>damnatum eſt pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, non extinctum.</hi>). Yet the worſt of theſe two Epoſitors here are and will be of better repute, even among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, then the Vindicators gloſſes ever were or will be.</p>
               <p>He ſaith further, [that here he expects that of Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpake this when he was a babe in grace.] But this is another of Mr. <hi>Tendring</hi>'s lies, for he ſaith onely the contrary, and proveth it out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. that <hi>Paul</hi> was not now in that weak and corrupt eſtate complained of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14, 24. and that therefore he ſpeaks it not of his own condition (though fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively in his own perſon) but in the behalfe of ſuch as were babes in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Pag. 26. by the former account, he citing <hi>Pauls</hi> words 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am cheif;</hi> bids us mark it, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks it not in the preterperfect tenſe, <hi>of whom I have been chief;</hi> but in the preſent tenſe, <hi>of whom I am cheif;</hi> as if <hi>Paul</hi> at that time were the chief of ſinners.] But did ever any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf (that was not beſides himſelf) think or ſay ſo? Is there not ſuch a <hi>figure</hi> in the Scripture as <hi>Enallage tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:29469:28"/>the putting of one tenſe for another? Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8, 9, 10. <hi>Ephoſ.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and even at the 13 verſ. before ſet forth his corrupt eſtate of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as a condition that was paſt?</p>
               <p>But he goes on out of <hi>Paul</hi> his 2 Epiſt. to I know not whom or what Church (for none is named) <hi>chap.</hi> 1. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. to the 13. to prove that <hi>Paul</hi> was not now a babe or child in Chriſt, but rather an old man; as he cals himſelf <hi>Paul the aged,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon.</hi> Truly as old as the Vindicator would make himſelf, he ſhews himſelf very young and childiſh in that his reaſoning: for we know none that affirms the thing that he goeth about to diſprove, but he loves to fight with his own ſhadow. In concluſion he ſaith that theſe Jeſuitical cavils (which yet are his own) are too well known, and never did, nor ſhall prevail againſt Gods truth. Then he goeth on from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe, upon which he makes as learned obſervations as he did formerly upon the firſt verſe; for whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith that <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus hath made us free from the Law of ſin and death;</hi> Here, ſaith he, [we may obſerve that the Apoſtle ſaith not that we are fully freed from ſin in this life, but from the Law of ſin.] But, firſt, it is evident that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that he was made free from that Law of ſin of which he had ſo much complained <hi>chap.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. Secondly, that he cals it <hi>a Law of death;</hi> as he doth <hi>chap.</hi> 7.24. <hi>a body of death,</hi> becauſe it hath death and condemnation appendant to it and involved in it. And thirdly, that he was now actually, even in this life, and for the preſent, freed therefrom. And laſtly, that it was not the death of Chriſt that had thus freed him, to wit from guilt, leaving the pollution behind, (as this Champion of corruption ſpeaks hereafter;) but it was <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus that had now freed him both from that Law of ſin, and of death</hi> its conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant: ſo that he cannot poſſibly ſpeak of his preſent condition in <hi>chap.</hi> 7. from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to the 24. And whereas he adds in the cloſe of that page, [that Chriſtian experience ſhews that no ſort of men are more troubled with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29469:28"/>then they whom God hath begun to deliver from the Law of ſin.] Though this be true, yet what is this to his purpoſe, or the propoſition which he would now maintain? for we ſpeak not what befals regenerate men at their firſt converſion, but of that which they do, or may attain by grace in the end. Nor do all temptations ariſe from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, they may proceed immediately from Satan, and aſſault ſuch as have no ſin or corruption left in them; as they did our firſt parents in innocency, and Chriſt himſelf as he was man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.</p>
               <p>Pag. 19. by the latter account, he rols the old ſtone with <hi>Syſiphus,</hi> ſaying, [that our deliverance from ſin is but begun, not perfected here, but that <hi>God is faithful by whom we are called</hi>] Then they are unfaithful that ſeek not to have the work finiſhed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. And there he breaks out into a great rapture, ſaying, [bleſſed be the Lord, that whereas before we were captives to ſin, now the caſe of the battel is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.] Why? what battel did we fight againſt ſin before grace did convert us unto God? [That ſin is become our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive through Chriſt.] Was it ſo with them in whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth, <hi>but I ſee another Law in my members warring againſt the Law of my mind, and bringing me into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to the Law of ſin that is in my members?</hi> we trow not; ſin was here too often the ſuperiour.</p>
               <p>That it remaineth in us not as a commander, but as a captive of the Lord Jeſus.] But doth it not till it be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued often circumvent us and prevail againſt us? and if ſo, then that of <hi>Peter</hi> is true, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 21.19. <hi>Of whom a man is overcome of the ſame is he brought into bondage;</hi> at leaſtwiſe for a time. He ſaith further, [that the bolts of ſin are yet upon our hands, and are left to admoniſh us of our former miſerable condition.] What are we under bolts and Irons, and yet no priſoners or captives? But Chriſt is ſent <hi>to preach deliverance to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to thoſe that are bound, and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God,</hi> to wit, againſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20, yet contrary to this and other promiſes, he ſaith, that we draw the chains
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29469:29"/>of our ſins after us, which make us move the more ſlowly. But it is the portion of the wicked to be in <hi>chains,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.10, 11. and <hi>to be bound hand and foot, Matth.</hi> 23.13. There are ſome that <hi>draw iniquity with cords of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Eſay</hi> 5.18. that is, with vain excuſes and diſtinctions, or ungrounded promiſes; <hi>wo to ſuch,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>wo, &amp;c.</hi> [But theſe chains, ſaith he, are not able to draw us into the bondage that we were in before.] Yes, they have done too many, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19, 20.</p>
               <p>That death which is the wages of ſin is ſo changed, that it is not the death of the man but the death of the ſin in the man.] <hi>What doth this babler ſay?</hi> the death that is the wages of ſin is <hi>the ſecond death in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10. and chap. 20.10, 15. Sin is the firſt death, and this is the ſecond; how then can this be any thing elſe but the death of a ſinner? There is another death indeed, that is the death of ſin, and not of the man, which is a ſuffering out of all temptations, and a dying with Chriſt unto all evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.15. <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints:</hi> of which ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. Of this death, and not of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, did <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> whom he cites, ſpeak, or elſe they were as much miſtaken as the Vindicator is in this matter, ſaying there [that the death which is brought out by ſin (he ſhould have ſaid, by Chriſt,) doth at the laſt even deſtroy and conſume it in the children of God, and that ſin will remain, though not reign.] Yes, if its will may take place, it will reign alſo, and that for ever. But he goes on, and comments thus upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye mortifie the deeds of the body:</hi> hereby, ſaith he, the Apoſtle ſhews, that after regeneration by grace, and before glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, grace is not conſummate, nor is corruption wholly aboliſhed.] But with what ſpectacles did he read this Text, when he found theſe things couchant in it? for out of the whole verſe he might have learned theſe ſaving truths, for his better information, and reformation alſo; Firſt, that God doth ſuſpend his final purpoſe and promiſes of our ſalvation upon Ifs, or conditions on our parts to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29469:29"/>
                  <hi>For if ye live after the fleſh,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, ye ſhall dye; but if ye mortifie the deeds of the body by the ſpirit ye ſhall live.</hi> Secondly, that the remaining corruptions in the Saints ſuch as theſe Romans were, have death and condemnation atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon them. Thirdly, that therefore they are not to be wounded only, but mortified, that is, abſolutely killed. And laſtly, that this is not to be done by the death of the body, but by the power of the Spirit, which we are to ſeek by grace, and with which we are to cooperate in this life till the work be done.</p>
               <p>His concluſion then from hence pag. 19. and 20. by the new account is falſe:] That as long as we live in the body there is ſome life of ſin remaining, which we had need to mortify and put off. [But not, as he doth, to put it off til our natural death.] But he addes Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſaying, [that our life here is <hi>bellum,</hi> not <hi>triumphus,</hi> a warfare, not a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phee of victory.] Yet may our warfare have an end here, and ſo to have our triumph and victory follow. <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, ſaith our God; ſpeak ye comfortably to Jeruſalem, and cry unto her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned.</hi> Epheſ. 6.13. <hi>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand in the evil day, and having done all to ſtand.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.6, 7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> But he contradicts himſelf in his next ſpeech pag. 20. by the new account, ſaying, [that in this battel we muſt fight without intermiſſion untill we have gotten the victory; for who can ſay that he hath in ſuch ſort cut off his ſuperfluities, that he hath no need of reforming?] Yes, <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. and the holy Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> 1 Ep. 4.17. and 5.5. with many thouſands more; to whom Chriſt bears witneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15, 20. and 14.4, 5.</p>
               <p>That when ſins and ſuperfluities are unregarded they kindle again.]</p>
               <p>That it is true that the ſame ſpiritual temptations may return after the former are quenched; but at length the Devil is by Chriſt to be caſt out with all his works. <hi>Rev.</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:29469:30"/>12.10, 11. <hi>And I heard a loud voice ſaying in heaven, now is come ſalvation and ſtrength, and the kingdome of our God, and the power of his Chriſt; for the accuſer of our brethren is caſt down, who accuſed them before God day and night.</hi> Yet he ſaith further, [That whoſoever he be, unleſs he diſſemble, he ſhall find within himſelf ſomething that had need to be ſubdued.] But ſuch a Pigmee in grace as he is (if he be under grace) muſt not meaſure the growth and mortification of Gods faithful and ſanctified Saints by his pitch. But he brings in ſome ſentences which he fathers upon <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as this, <hi>velis nolis infra ſine; tuos habitabit</hi> (but he ſaith <hi>habitavit;</hi>) <hi>Jebuſaeus ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This is true of temptations, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for a time after our firſt converſion; but this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlict, if we beſtir our ſelves aright, ſhall have an end here, as we have proved of late: ſome Jeſubites are our ſins and corruptions, which muſt be rooted out; again, ſome Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites are our native faculties as they are corrupted, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and poyſoned with rebellion; Theſe alſo may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and brought into obedience, but neither can be caſt out, nor ought to be: howbeit we have ſure promiſes that all our ſins and corruptions ſhall be ſubdued, if we will ſue out the benefit of the ſame. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will turn again, he will have compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue all our iniquities, and thou will caſt their ſins into the depths of the ſea.</hi> Inſomuch as that there ſhall not be one Canaanite left in our ſoul which is the houſe and the temple of the Lord; So <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.21. <hi>And in that day there ſhall be no more the Canaanite in the houſe of the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Yet he goes on ſaying, ſaying</p>
               <p>That the great deceitfulneſs of mans heart, of which the Lord complaineth <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. ſaying, <hi>the heart of man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> it is attributed to all men, good and bad indifferently, Chriſt onely excepted.] It is well he will except Chriſt himſelf here, for he did not in his poſitions. But he might have excepted all who were Chriſts truly unto the end.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore all his affirmations that follow in that page are falſe, at leaſtwiſe in his ſenſe and notion, as, [That all mens hearts are alike by nature.] True they are alike moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the firſt, but not corrupt, as he would have it.</p>
               <p>That corruption is not from the inſtrument, but from the Author. Then God muſt be the Author of our corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by his doctrine.</p>
               <p>That men beget children as they are men, not as they are regenerate and holy men.] Yet the Apoſtle giveth the Saints ſome priviledge above others, ſaying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That nature with its corruption is derived, but not grace, for that is ſupernatural.] And is not corruption a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and an adventitious thing alſo?</p>
               <p>That grace makes no ſuch change in this life, but the hearts of the beſt are in ſome ſort deceitful.] Which he preſently contradicteth, ſaying, though he gave <hi>Nathaniel</hi> that praiſe, that <hi>there was no guile in his heart.</hi> Yea <hi>David,</hi> ſaith he, doth the like to any juſtified man, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.1, 2. how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, ſaith he, this is onely true of the ſpirit or regenerate part, and not of the fleſh of the old man, who by reaſon of his age is often too hard for the young man; where he contradicts himſelf in what he had ſaid before, that ſin is our captive, and doth not reign at any time, but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the regenerate: That it hath its deaths blow pag. 21. by the former account; ſo that the beſt Expoſitors, (he meaneth for his tooth and palate,) read this Text thus; the whole heart of the wicked is deceitful with a full, ſtrong, and reigning deceitfulneſs, and but part of the heart of the godly, namely the unregenerate part, but in a weaker mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as being diſcerned and ſtroven againſt.</p>
               <p>That the heart of the wicked ſhews it ſelf ſuch in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29469:31"/>whole courſe of their lives. And yet by and by he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelfe, ſaying, that nevertheleſs the heart of the wicked may be upright in ſome particular actions, as <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> was in taking of <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 20.6.</p>
               <p>That the heart of the godly is only deceitfull in ſome particular actions, as <hi>David</hi> was upright in all things ſave in the matter of <hi>Uriah.</hi>] But I demand, whether <hi>David</hi> might not have avoided even thoſe ſirs of bloodſhed and murther by watchfulneſſe and prayer, as well as other Saints ſhould have done? if ſo, he might have overcome all ſinne, and no doubt he did ſo in the end.</p>
               <p>He ſaith further, that every regenerate man is partly fleſh and partly ſpirit. True, he is ſo at the firſt, but not always: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>For the Law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Ieſus hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> where was then the fleſh?</p>
               <p>That hereupon ariſeth the war in their hearts like the ſtrugling in <hi>Rebecca's</hi> womb] But did that ſtrugling laſt all her life long?</p>
               <p>That the regenerate here are but like the dawning of the day, wherein darkneſſe and light are mixed.] But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The path of the juſt is like the ſhining light that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the regenerate may be like a cup of wine mingled with water.] True both at the beginning of their new birth, and for a good ſpace after, yea all their life long through their own default. [which veſſel or cup, ſaith he, is not halfe water and halfe wine, but wholly wine and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water] Doth the man underſtand what he ſaith? By this ſaying of his, and his ſimilitude, the regenerate ſhould be wholly renewed and wholly corrupt; which he contradicts with another compariſon, ſaying [even as a veſſel filled with equall proportions of hot and cold water (it would make a dog ſpue to heare him) it is not halfe cold and halfe hot (it is both) but wholly lukewarm, that is, partly hot and partly cold in all the parts of it.] If this be not a clear contradiction, or an abſolute piece of nonſenſe, I know not what is ſuch. And whereas he ſaith, [that a regenerate man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29469:31"/>is partly holy and partly unholy in all the parts and powers of the body and ſoul (what is he ſo in the regenerate part alſo, of which he ſpake erewhile?) yet the denomination of a regenerate man is always given him in Scripture <hi>à parte praeſtantiore.</hi>] But he is miſtaken, where it hath not the upper hand, it is otherwiſe: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3, 13. <hi>And I, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, could not ſpeak unto you as ſpiritual men, but as unto car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, even as unto babes in Chriſt; I ſed you with milk, and not with ſtrong meat, for ye were not able to beare it, nor yet are ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for ye are yet carnal; for whereas there are among you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying, ſtrife and diviſions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaith that the Lord who made the heart, Pag. 22 by the new account, pronounceth us all guilty of ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.] Doth he ſo to us? did we live in that age? But yet it is true of every fallen man in the generall; but that guilt doth not always lye upon the Saints for new ſins: and there he heaps many Texts of Scripture (which ſpeak of the ſtate of the unregenerate) to prove that the regenerate are here always ſinful; as <hi>Iob</hi> 5.2. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.2. and 64.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3, 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. yea though the godly have many failings in their babeſhip, and ſome in their growing up, in which regard they cannot juſtifie themſelves, but muſt take guilt and ſhame to themſelves, as <hi>Iob</hi> doth chap. 8.29, 30. and <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 130.3. and 43.2. and <hi>Solomon</hi> teſtifieth of all men till they be throughly purged, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>That there is no man that ſinneth not,</hi> or may not ſin: yet none of thoſe places lays upon us a neceſſity of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſin all our days, nor makes ſin impoſſible to be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here by the grace and helpe of Chriſt; which is the point that he ſhould prove.</p>
               <p>But he bids us mark what is written 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>that Chriſt was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> Which we admit, but not in his ſenſe, ſaying, that the Apoſtle doth not ſay <hi>actively</hi> that we ſhould make or work out our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, but <hi>poſitively</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid <hi>paſſively</hi>) <hi>that we ſhould be made the righteouſneſſe of God;</hi> and that not by our ſelves, leſt we ſhould glory in our own ſalvation, but by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

               <p>But as the former part of his obſervation is falſe, that we ſhould not actually work out our own righteouſneſſe by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſo it is evident that he underſtands not what he ſpeaks in the latter words of his ſpeech, about being made righteous by another, even Jeſus Chriſt: for there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſneſſe for men to ſeek after but that which is required in the moral Law. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25. <hi>And it ſhall be our reghteouſneſſe if we obſerve to doe all theſe commandements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord our God as he hath commanded us:</hi> which yet is of two ſorts or degrees; the one is the righteouſneſſe of grace and juſtification whereby ſin is to be purged out; and the other is the righteouſneſſe of glorification: of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteouſneſſe ſhall reign by one Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and of the latter of theſe <hi>David</hi> thus, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. <hi>verſ</hi> 142. <hi>Thy righteouſneſſe is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting righteouſneſſe, and thy Law is the truth:</hi> and verſ. 144. <hi>The righteouſneſſe of thy teſtimonies is everlaſting.</hi> This is that <hi>David</hi> hoped for in the end; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17.15. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy face in righteouſneſſe, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſſe.</hi> So Pſalm 24.45. <hi>He ſhall receive the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Lord, even righteouſneſſe from the God of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> and 69.27. <hi>Add iniquity to his iniquity, and let him not enter into thy righteouſneſſe:</hi> and <hi>Paul Gal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteouſneſſe by faith.</hi> 2 Tim. 4 8. <hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> And as both thoſe are attained by faith, ſo they are called the righteouſneſſe of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>For therein, to wit in the Goſpel, is the righteouſneſſe of God revealed from faith to faith,</hi> verſ 18. <hi>for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe and unrighteouſneſſe of men.</hi> So circumciſion, the ſigne of ſanctification, is called <hi>the ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith, Rom.</hi> 4.11. and the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining himſelfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. what that righteouſneſſe of God is which he would attain by the faith of Chriſt, ſaith <hi>that I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29469:32"/>and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable to his death, if by any means I might attain to the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> And both theſe are to be attained by Chriſt; in which regard he is called <hi>the end of the Law for Righteouſneſſe ſake to every one that beleeveth,</hi> Rom. 10.4. And as <hi>he is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Father that the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in us who walke not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit, Rom.</hi> 8.4. ſo he is called <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23.6. as is the holy Ghoſt, the heavenly Jeruſalem alſo in its deſcention unto us called likewiſe <hi>Jehovah ſidkena, the Lord our righteouſneſſe, Jerem.</hi> 34.16. which is that life the Saints hoped for <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. as was ſaid before. If any man find any other righteouſneſſe of God unto ſalvation men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned cleerly in the Scriptures, let him takn it for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; for that <hi>one mans obedience whereby many ſhall be made righteous, Rom.</hi> 5.19. is the obedience of Chriſt within us to be attained by faith for the fulfilling of the Law, and the former of thoſe two righteouſneſſes, and not his obedrence without us. Let every one take heed how he caſts his own ſoul, or make the ſouls of others depend upon any other righteouſneſſe of God which hath no footing for it in the holy Scriptures; but though there is no outward obedience of Chriſt for us that is made our righteouſneſſe by the Lord, yet by his paſſive obedience Saints that forſake ſin, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it by his grace, <hi>are redemed from the curſe of the Law, Gal.</hi> 3.13. By which he alſo perfects or completes for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thoſe <hi>which are ſanctified by faith in him, Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. Theſe things thus being opened and premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we ſhall appeal unto all that are godly-wiſe, whether thoſe that are deſirous to be ſaved are not to work out their own righteouſneſſe and ſalvation by faith and obedience in Jeſus Chriſt. See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 24.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Iſai</hi> 51.1. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto me ye that follow after righteouſneſſe, ye that ſeek the Lord,</hi> chap. 56.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, keep ye judgement and doe juſtice, (or righteouſneſſe) for my ſalvation is neere, and my righteouſneſſe ready to be revealed.</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my beloved as ye have always obeyed, not as in my preſence only, but much more in my abſence, ſo work out your ſalvation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29469:33"/>with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> See 1 Tim. 6.11, 12. <hi>But thou O man of God, flee thoſe things, and follow after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, godlineſs, faith, love, patience, meekneſs; fight the good ſight of faith, lay hold of eternal life. David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 119.166. <hi>O Lord, I have hoped for thy ſalvation, and kept</hi> (or done) <hi>thy commandements;</hi> and ſo muſt all do in Chriſt that will be ſaved. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep his commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter through the gate into the city.</hi> But he goeth on, and ſaith out of <hi>Job, [Who can bring a clean thing out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean?

               </p>
               <p>But he ſaith page 23 by the new account, [That if my friends could produce but one ſuch man, and prove it, then I would yield the bucklers.] But if we cannot produce any ſuch man in our corrupt, blind, and unbelieving age, ſhall our unbelief make the faith and promiſes of God of none effect? for though it is true <hi>à poſſe ad eſſe non valet conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> ſo it is as true, that <hi>à non eſſe ad non poſſe fieri non eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludendum,</hi> eſpecially where we have Gods help ingaged by his promiſes, if we will ſeek it: But becauſe we will now lay claim to the bucklers, and that upon his clear and immediate promiſe, we will ſhew him <hi>John</hi> with many his fellow-Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. as was ſhewed before; <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of Judgment, becauſe as he is ſo are we in this preſent world:</hi> we can alſo ſhew him many thouſands (as we have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) of ſuch perfect ones even in this life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9, 17. and 14.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>But here he produceth by the help of ſome good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the teſtimonies of the Fathers, (for he never read them himſelf;) unto which when we have anſwered we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29469:33"/>will pay him in his own coine: That it was the prerogative of Chriſt alone, among all grown men, to know no ſin, and to be found <hi>ſolus in hominibus qualis quaerebatur in pecoribus,</hi> (not <hi>in peccoribus,</hi> as he hath it) <hi>alone ſuch among men as was ſought among the beaſts, an unblamable lamb without ſpot.</hi> Here he having cited <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.6. ſaying, <hi>we like ſheep have gone aſtray:</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. that the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, he might have ſpared <hi>Auguſtine contra Pelag. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. and <hi>Gregorie lib.</hi> 3. in <hi>Reg. cap.</hi> 6. ſaying, <hi>There is no man that hath not ſome corruption in him which he may and ſhould lament:</hi> For take all this as ſpoken of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, or the regenerate that hath not fulfilled his courſe with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. and we have often affirmed the ſame.</p>
               <p>But he brings <hi>Hieronymus contra Jovinian. lib.</hi> 2. ſaying, <hi>No man is clean from ſin, though he live but one day upon the long earth:</hi>] Which is true of the ſinful earth ſpoken of <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>mortifie therefore your members upon earth;</hi> although we know that in that ſaying <hi>Hierom</hi> and others ſuffered the Septuagints ill tranſlation of <hi>Job</hi> to impoſe upon them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Further, he brings <hi>Bernard</hi> upon <hi>Cant. ſerm.</hi> 2. ſaying, <hi>Non peccare Dei juſtitia eſt, not to ſin is the juſtice and property of God, but remiſſion of ſin is the juſtice of man:</hi>] To which we ſay, that the former is but true in part, for the elect Angels never ſinned; and the latter ſcarcely true at all, for remiſſion of ſins is one thing, and righteouſneſs is another; And where the remiſſion of ſin follows, the righteouſneſs of ſanctification to purge them away muſt go before of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Sed unus Bernardus non vidit omnia.</hi> And his own concluſions there are as falſe; for, ſaith he, [As the Ivy will not die untill the Oke be cut down; (but Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews that if you cut the Ivy at the root it will forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

But he brings us more of this <hi>Ambroſia</hi> out of <hi>Ambroſe de Paenit. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. ſaying, [<hi>It is not the voice of thy family, I am whole, and need not a phyſician;</hi> but, <hi>heale me O Lord and I ſhall be healed.</hi>] But if it be the voice of his family, of what family is the Vindicator, who ſaith, that the Lord cannot <hi>or will not heal us?</hi> is it death that muſt do that work for us? is it not the voice of his family, firſt, to come to him for an abſolute cure, and then with the woman who was cured of her bloody iſſue, and the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed leper, and many others, to come and give God thanks? But he goes on page 23, 24. with <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſpeaking thus to the <hi>Novatian</hi> hereticks of his time, [and ſaith, it may fitly be turned to the Jeſuits of our time; <hi>Dareſt thou, O Jeſuit, call thy ſelf clean and holy? albeit thou wert clean in regard of thy workes, this one word were enough to make thee unclean.</hi>] To which I ſay, firſt, that the way wherein <hi>Paul</hi> worſhipped the God of his Fathers was called Hereſie, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.14.

But laſtly, this pretender to no leſs degree then of a Doctor of Divinity doth not ſee that there is a groſs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29469:34"/>abſurdity, if not contradiction, in the words which he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſaying, <hi>albeit thou wert clean in regard of thy works, this one word, I am clean,</hi> (which in that caſe is but the truth) <hi>were enough to make thee unclean.</hi> We hope the Vindicator hereafter will not be too forward to ſpeak the truth any more then he hath done heretofore, leſt, as he ſaith out of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> it make him unclean.</p>

But we would aske <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againe, doth Chriſt contradict himſelf in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29469:35"/>that prayer, when he teacheth to pray, <hi>thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven?</hi> But he interrogating ſaith, is this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be ſaid of Chriſt only, or of beleevers alſo? Yea, it is the prayer of the ſons of God alſo, for they call God father all which is true, but nothing to the purpoſe. But he proceeds, ſaying, [what are ye that ſay ye have no ſin? Lyars, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.] To which firſt we ſay, that men that ſay they have ſin may be liars, and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious liars alſo; witneſſe the Vindicator. And ſecondly, that ſome men may ſay they know no ſin by themſelves for the preſent, and yet ſpeake the truth therein as <hi>Paul</hi> did 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. but if any man ſaith he hath not ſinned at all he is a liar; and ſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> explains that in the firſt Epiſt. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. which he had ſpoken more darkely, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to the babes in Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. as may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. where he ſaith, <hi>My little children, theſ things have I written unto you that ye ſin not:</hi>] What doth he put them upon impoſſibilities then? No, he furniſheth them there and in the next verſe with ſuch a propitiator and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of ſin, as is able to cure and take away the ſins of the whole world if they would ſeek unto him; for it is Jeſus Chriſt the juſt or righteous. But whereas in the next place he cites againſt us, <hi>Luk</hi> 17.10. <hi>When ye ſhall have done all theſe things that are commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we have done that which is our duty to do.</hi> But he is here like the man poſſeſſed, <hi>who cut himſelfe with ſtones Mark</hi> 5.5. for this Text ſhews, that if we doe all thoſe things that are commanded us, (which he implyeth that we may doe) yet we doe but our duty therein, and add nothing to the Lord, and in that regard are but unprofitable ſervants, and no d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our Maſter. O how unprofitable are they then who neither will doe all thoſe things that are commanded, nor ſuffer other men to be at quiet who indeavour to do, and teach others their duty therein.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, that we have a ſilly ſubterfuge for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our perfection, or rather for ſaying we are unprofitable ſervants, that were we never ſo righteous, for humility ſake we ſhould ſay we are unprofitable ſervants. But he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29469:35"/>anſwereth with Saint <hi>Auguſtine, proper humilitatem ergo mentiris, Therefore for humility ſake thou lyeſt;</hi> but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Chriſt never taught men for humility to ly.] No, he did not, but <hi>Anguſtine</hi> and he are far from truth if they ſay that Chriſt hath not taught them who hath fulfilled the Law and Gods will to ſay that they are ſtill unprofitable ſervants; for, <hi>can a man be profitable to God as he that is wiſe is profitable to himſelfe? Iob</hi> 22.2.</p>
               <p>But he urgeth us again with <hi>Bernards</hi> words, firſt, <hi>in Anun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatione Mariae, who is better then the prophet David,</hi> of whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>I have found a man after mine own heart; and yet he need not to ſay, enter not into judgement with thy ſervant.</hi>] True, ſo hath every man, in regard of his manifold former ſins, but not always in regard of ſins newly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when he is throughly ſanctified as they were, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.17, 18. yet there is a time of greater grace and growth in grace promiſed then that which <hi>David</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.18. <hi>In that day ſhall the Lord defend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Jeruſalem, and he that is fallen, or a feeble one among them at that day ſhall be as David, and the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he alledgeth this ſaying out of <hi>Bernard</hi> 23. Serm. 25. upon <hi>Cantic.

               <p>But he brings a third ſaying of his in Serm. 10 <hi>contra vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ingrati.

               </p>
               <p>But page 25 he ſaith, Wo to the miſerable generation, in whom their own inſufficiency ſeems ſufficiency.] So ſay we, for <hi>our ſufficiency is of God alone,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and we alſo bewaile the miſerable generation that ſhall die in their ſins, becauſe they believe not a ſufficiency in Chriſt alone, but in and through weakneſs it ſelf (a corporal death) to purge away the droſs and filthineſs oi ſin, <hi>John</hi> 8.21, 24. which alſo is his unbeleife.

               <p>But this is one of his digreſſions and impertinences, for we plead not for ſuch an abſolute degree of perfection as is expected in the world to come, but a limited one, which is called perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> yet containeth a love of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and of our neighbour as of our ſelves, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth all contrary luſts and ſins. In purſuit of this ſaid digreſſion he brings two arguments out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to prove that <hi>Zachary,</hi> of whom he ſpeaks <hi>chap.</hi> 1.6. did not perfectly walk in all the commandements of God. The firſt is this [becauſe he was a Prieſt, and was bound as well
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29469:36"/>
                  <hi>to offer for his own ſins as for the ſins of his people, Heb.</hi> 3.5.] Yet this he might do for his former ſins, though he were now perfect for the preſent: ſo that this argument holds nor. But the ſecond, which he hath page 26. of the new account, is more childiſh then the former; [That becauſe he is ſaid <hi>to walk in the commandements,</hi> he had not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the mark; for they that are at their journies end ſit ſtill.] But it is not ſo in the kingdome of God, for though <hi>they reſt from their labours,</hi> that is, from their conflict againſt ſin and Satan, yet they walk in the perfection of Gods commandements for ever: and if he fancied any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eternal life to himſelf then the fulneſs of love and righteouſneſs required by the Law, he was miſtaken in the mark at which all true Saints aim. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.3. <hi>For there he commanded the bleſſing and life for evermore.</hi> Epheſ. 1.4. <hi>As he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.4, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 15.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. before cited: To which he adds a third argument of his own, [Becauſe he was ſmitten with dumbneſs for not believing the Angels promiſe.] But as there is no moral precept for that, ſo it infringeth not what <hi>Luke</hi> hath ſaid of him <hi>chap.</hi> 1.6. where he tells us as before [that the Apoſtle doth conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh between <hi>peccatum</hi> and <hi>crimen,</hi> betwixt ſin and crime, that is, ſaith he, ſome grievous offence which giveth ſlander, and is worthy of crimination.] Is not all ſin then worthy of crimination? But he voucheth <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, [<hi>That the life of holy men may be ſaid to be without crime.</hi> (yet he thought otherwiſe who ſaid, <hi>nemo ſine crimtne vivit;</hi>) but not without ſin.] Which is true of a mans whole race or courſe, that it is, and hath been ſinfull; but not of the Saints laſt and beſt attainments, or poſſibilities through grace, as we ſhall afterwards ſhew out of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> own confeſſion, who is here again brought in ſaying <hi>[Men live well if they live without crime.]</hi> But they live better when by grace they live without ſin. But that is egregiouſly falſe which follows [that he who thinks he can (to wit by the help of Chriſt) live without ſin, he doth not thereby make
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29469:37"/>himſelf free from ſin, (Yes, if he do not, he may do it in time.) but debars himſelf of the pardon of his ſins.] But Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks otherwiſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Is not the forſaking of ſin for the preſent the high way to pardon for our ſins paſt? See <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 22. But after that former digreſſion he returneth again to his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about perfection and righteouſneſs, wherein there is little of right, and leſs of perfection to be found; for, firſt, he ſaith out of his own cerebel, [that there is a two-fold perfection or righteouſneſs, the firſt imputed, which is by way of relation, and doth perfectly juſtifie us before God: (for which you muſt take his word, for he brings no proofe to make it good;) the ſecond is infuſed by way of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſubjectively in us; [and this (ſaith he) is but inchoate and imperfect, and cannot juſtifie us before God.] But we have proved before out of <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſanctification are all one thing, and therefore if the righteouſneſs of ſanctification be onely inchoated, and not perfected in this life, then we cannot be fully juſtified before God; for there is no other righteouſneſs to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for our juſtification then that: hence it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. nothing interveneth between our calling and glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but juſtification, by which ſanctification (as being all one thing) is to be underſtood: <hi>Moreover, thoſe whom he foreknew thoſe he called, and whom he called thoſe he juſtified, and thoſe he juſtified them he alſo glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, he brings [a diſtinction of <hi>extrinſecal</hi> and <hi>intrinſecal</hi> righteouſneſs out of <hi>Zanchie,</hi> of which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal (ſaith he) is the adventitious (he might have ſaid the fictitious) is the perfection of condonation, where our imperfections are truly pardoned for the death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, according to that of <hi>Auguſtine; All the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are reputed as done when that is remitted which is left undone.</hi>] But where had the Biſhop of <hi>Hippo</hi> this <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomanes?</hi> for the holy Ghoſt ſaith <hi>tranſmutatis terminis</hi> the clean contrary; that when the cammandements are kept
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29469:37"/>and fulfilled for the preſent, then all that was amiſs before becomes pardoned. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 22, 23. <hi>If the wicked will return from all his ſins which he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, and not die; all his tranſgreſſions which he hath committed they ſhall not be mentioned unto him, in the righteouſneſs of that he hath done he ſhall live.</hi> Doth not Chriſt require an actual keeping and performance of the commandements of every one that will enter into life? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> 1 Cor. 7.19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, nor uncircumciſion, but the keeping of the commandements of God.</hi> Rev. 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life,</hi> as before. [And this righteouſneſs, ſaith he, rather conſiſteth in the pardon of ſins then in the perfection of vertue.] But where is the pardon of ſins called righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? for though the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. ſpeaks of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs that lieth not in the imputing of ſin, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of righteouſneſs without works; yet that not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of ſin is the purging away ſin by Gods Spirit; as is evident out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2, 3. which place ſhould be thus rendred; <hi>O the bleſſedneſs of the man whoſe tranſgreſſions are taken away, and whoſe ſins are covered!</hi> (to wit, by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.) <hi>O the bleſſedneſs of the man to whom the Lord will not impute iniquity,</hi> (by letting it remain unpurged away) <hi>and in whoſe Spirit there is no guile!</hi> For the laſt words of the Text do evince that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks here of ſanctification, as knowing no other juſtification: and the imputing of righteouſneſs without works (that is, our own works) is the free beſtowing of the righteouſneſſe of ſanctification, and the perfection of vertue, which the vertuous Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator here ſets aſide. The intrinſecal perfection or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which he ſpeaks of out of <hi>Zanchy,</hi> is, ſaith he, the perfection of inheſion, and this is ſaid to be either <hi>abſolute</hi> or <hi>comparative.</hi> It is ſaid to be <hi>abſolute</hi> (ſaith he) when our hearts are ſincere, and ſimply free from Hypocriſie and double-dealing with God. Thus <hi>Job</hi> was <hi>a perfect man,</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29469:38"/>
                  <hi>David a man after Gods own heart,</hi> becauſe his heart was ever ſincere towards him, and ſeeking after God.] <hi>Pardon a moi:</hi> it was ſo habitually, but not ever ſo, for then he had not fallen in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> But where there is no guile at all there is no ſin left, as we ſaid before; for all ſin is full of guile and deceitful luſts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.21, 22. Secondly, [it is <hi>comparative</hi> (ſaith he) page 27. in reſpect of others, as <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. <hi>to be perfect in his generation.</hi>] But by his leave, thoſe words are to be underſtood abſolutely as well as comparatively; for his faith and obedience was ſo perfect that he not onely obtained to have himſelf and his family preſerved, and to be made a ſeed or remnant for the new or ſecond world, but <hi>he became thereby an heir of the righteouſneſs which is by faith, Heb.</hi> 11.7. But it is the Vindicators practiſe to detract from the choſen Saints of God, to patronize corruption, and reſerve it all his life long. [It is, ſaith he, of this perfection which <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, ſaying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1. <hi>But we ſpeak wiſdome amongſt thoſe that are perfect.</hi>] And why muſt it be ſo taken? for <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake thoſe myſteries of Chriſt, which might and did paſs for wiſdome, not onely among the other Apoſtles and moſt perfect men, but among the Angels alſo, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. But he goes on in the 27 page, ſaying,</p>
               <p>As for any other abſolute perfection, <hi>Paul</hi> is abſolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.] But that is an abſolute falſhood; for though he modeſtly ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Not as though I had attained, or were already perfect;</hi> yet he is ſo farre from being againſt it, that he preſently addes, <hi>but I follow after, if I may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that for which I am apprehended of Chriſt.</hi> And ver. 13, 14. <hi>But this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth to thoſe things which are before, I preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the mark of the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt.</hi> We ſay he doth not only ſtrive for it himſelf, and ſtirs up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thereunto, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.14. but prayeth for the Churches that they may attain it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. and 11.18, 19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10, 11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.19, 21.</p>
               <p>That ſaying of <hi>Bernard,</hi> Sermon 50. <hi>ſuper Cant.</hi> which he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29469:38"/>there ſubjoyneth, was not adviſedly uttered at the firſt, nor here recited by him, to wit, <hi>[Who dare arrogate that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which Paul denieth?]</hi> For, firſt, ſuch as attain to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do rather conceal it then boaſt of it. Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not deny all perfection, but in that very Epiſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits that which we contend for, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.13. ſaying, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me.</hi> To ſay nothing of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 37, 38, 39. where he ſaith not onely that <hi>he was in Chriſt more then conquerour,</hi> but ſpeaks of an immovable love which God through Chriſt had planted in him, therewith he ſtood faſt.</p>
               <p>Then in concluſion he cometh to his laſt diſtinction of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal</hi> perfection, ſaying, it is either of <hi>parts,</hi> or <hi>degrees;</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the former is when a man hath <hi>a reſpect,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>to all the commandements of God,</hi> and allows not in his heart the breach of any. The ſecond is, when a man performeth exactly all that the Law in its full rigour requireth.] But mark how he ſets theſe two out by compariſon: he that is perfect in the firſt ſenſe (ſaith he) may fitly be reſembled to a weak and feeble child who hath all the integral and perfect parts of a man, yet not integrally or perfectly; But he that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the ſecond ſenſe is like a ſtrong and full-grown man, that hath all his parts in their perfection: And we confeſs, ſaith he, that the Saints of God in this life may have the perfection of parts, becauſe that in ſome meaſure they may love every good, and hate every evill, though not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as touching the exactneſs of performance, yet habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually as touching a conſtant reſolution. But that a man ſhould have the perfection of degrees we utterly deny, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can neither love the good nor hate the evil as we ſhould do.] From all which we may obſerve, that though he affects the higheſt degree in the Schools, to be called a Doctor of Divinity, yet he will have the regenerate in this life, for all their ſtriving againſt ſin, and labouring after perfection, which he often ſpeaks of, to proceed no further, nor to grow to any higher ſtature then to be alwayes babes in this life: Whereas <hi>John</hi> writes unto three forms, ages, or degrees of Saints; to babes, to young men, and to old
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29469:39"/>men, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth tell us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. that <hi>Chriſt gave gifts unto men, ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome paſtors and teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> or <hi>till we all come in the unity of the Spirit, and the acknowledgement of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the meaſure of the ſtature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt.</hi> And the Apoſtle doth not only reprove thoſe that remained babes and ſucklings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. but exhorts all the Saints to become <hi>men perfect,</hi> or <hi>of a ripe age</hi> (as it is in the Greek) <hi>in underſtanding,</hi> and all concomitant graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. Is not this doctrine like the medicine which he gives to whelps to hinder their growth? Page 28. he firſt tels us [that the Jeſuites, <hi>Bellarmine, Becanus,</hi> and others, do wreſt divers Scriptures to prove the perfection of the Saints in this life.] But haply they may, and doe ſtrain ſome teſtimonies of Scripture too far, yet they need not doe it, for there are as many cleare and full Scriptures to prove the poſſibility of attaining ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this life as we contend for, as there are to prove the Trinity in the Deity, or two natures united in Chriſts one perſon, or that there are ten commandements. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though he brings not one of thoſe teſtimonies forth, yet he will needs anſwer them by whole-ſale, or in the Lump; ſome of which anſwers he fathers upon <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> as juſtly he may, for by fits he is againſt perfection, yet ſometimes for it.</p>
               <p>The firſt whereof is this, that ſome of thoſe teſtimonies are exhortations ſhewing us what we ſhould do, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what we can doe; for admonitions doe not ſhew us, <hi>ut tantum praeſtari poſſit quantum ſuadetur, that ſo much can be performed as is injoyned;</hi> but ſhew us <hi>quouſ<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> conari oportet, how earneſtly we ſhould ſtrive to perform them,</hi> though we be not able perfectly to obſerve them.] But this is falſe, and a meer ſubterfuge unworthy of a Doctor ſo cryed up as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was, for although the Schools diſtinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween counſells and commands, and all exhortations ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and preſſed in the name of the Lord, and thoſe in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall which tend to the purging out of all ſin, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29469:39"/>of the Law in Chriſt; yet are not only precepts, but poſſible to the Saints, as the ſaid <hi>Auguſtine</hi> elſwhere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth. The School alſo ſaith, and that truly, <hi>Ultra poſſe viri non vult Deus ulla requiri, God promiſeth grace to fulfil all that he requireth.</hi> Secondly, he ſaith [that many of thoſe places of Scripture do ſhew us not what we are now <hi>in via, in the way,</hi> but what we ſhall be hereafter <hi>in patria, at the end of our pilgrimage,</hi> when we ſhall be freed from the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our fleſh, and clothed with the garment of perfect righteouſneſſe.] Yea they doe in a ſpeciall manner ſhew us both what we are, and what we ſhould be now <hi>in via,</hi> or here now, yet it cannot fully be ſet forth what we ſhall be hereafter; for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But as it is written, eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Thirdly, he ſaith, [that in many places the Scripture (but he cannot produce one ſuch) terms them perfect and immaculate which have defiled their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and polluted their conſciences; mark, ſaith he, not with no ſins, which is impoſſible, but with no groſſe ſins, or damnable enormities; which, as is ſaid before, is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.] But firſt, we think the Vindicator alloweth no ſin to be veniall, but all mortal and damnable, though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſuch. Secondly, we ſay that while any man pollutes his conſcience he is neither called or accounted either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or immaculate by the Lord, <hi>who is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity, Haba.</hi> 1.13. And thirdly, what though all men have ſo defiled their garments for a time? yet it is not impoſſible at length through grace to keep our ſouls and conſciences ſo unſpotted; for ſo had <hi>Paul</hi> done, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. and knowing that the like grace was attainable for others, he prayed for it in their behalfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>that ye may be ſincere and without offence till the day of Jeſus Chriſt, being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23. <hi>And the very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly, that your whole ſpirit, ſoul and body, be preſerved blameleſs until the coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> See alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.19, 20. before cited. Fourthly, he ſaith [the Scripture pronounceth men perfect
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29469:40"/>blameleſs and bleſſed, not becauſe they have no ſins, but becauſe their ſins are not imputed unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. But we have ſhewed before that this not imputing is a purging them away by ſanctification as well as a remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Further he ſaith [and therefore though the Saints are called righteous and perfect, not only in regard of the imputative righteouſneſſe which is wrought in them by the Spirit of Chriſt: but we muſt underſtand in what ſenſe the Saints are inherently called righteous; for we muſt not think them to be ſo perfectly righteous as to be void of ſin, or to be juſtified in the ſight of God, becauſe that together with the ſanctification of the Saints there is ſtill in them a remainder of original coruption, by the touch and ſtain of which their beſt works are corrupted and defiled; and therefore we ſay, that though the Saints and holy men of God may and have lived <hi>ſine ſcandalo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence,</hi> and page 29. <hi>ſine querela, without reproof and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint</hi> on mans part, by or in the obſervance of all outward principles, yet it is impoſſible the beſt of them ſhould live and die <hi>ſine peccato, without ſin.</hi> So he] Unto all which we briefly anſwer, that his diſtinction of <hi>imputative</hi> and <hi>inherent</hi> righteouſneſſe is vain; for they are all one, as we have ſhewed before. Secondly, the Saints are, or ought to be, ſo perfectly righteous by inherent righteouſneſs, as to be thereby juſtified in the ſight of God; whether the word be taken for a purging from ſin, as it is <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. or for a poſitive righteouſneſſe, as <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. for there is no other way of juſtification in Chriſt unto eternal life ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Scriptures. Thirdly, we have proved before that there is not, nor ought to be, ſuch a remainder of original corruption always found in the beſt Saints, as to ſtain and corrupt their beſt works. Laſtly, we have likewiſe aſſerted by clear Scriptures, that the Saints through Chriſt not only may but ſhould live here at the length not alone <hi>ſine ſcandalo</hi> and <hi>querela,</hi> but <hi>ſine peccato,</hi> without ſin as well as without ſcandal or juſt reproof, <hi>for to that end Chriſt gave himſelfe, Epheſ.</hi> 5.24, 25, 26. But he tels us in that 29 pag. [that <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2. is a remarkable place] So it is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29469:40"/>indeed, but not for his purpoſe, to prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> lived and dyed an imperfect man, and with ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of corruption in him: which words ought to be thus tranſlated, as they lye in the Greek Text, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that Abraham our father hath found according to the fleſh?</hi> (or in his unregenerate eſtate) <hi>for if Abraham were juſtified by works</hi> (to wit before, not after grace received) <hi>he hath whereof to glory, but not before God;</hi> as he proveth in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſe: but of this more in another place. Then here he ſhews by a diſtinction that [the Saints whom he holds to be always imperfect in this life may be in a four-fold ſenſe called perfect. Firſt, in regard of their intention and aime at, and deſire of perfection; for reſting in a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaith he, is contrary to grace: <hi>grow in grace.</hi>] But may not the Saints reſt when they are at the end of their journey and race, which is the final mortification of ſin through faith? according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. <hi>For we which have beleeved doe enter into reſt.</hi> Let him here who is <hi>tantus temporum obſervator, ſuch an obſerver of tenſes</hi> before, mark the tenſes here, for the work of beleeving is paſt, and the entring into reſt is preſent, The Saints in heaven are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in a good condition, is it againſt grace for them to reſt in it? Secondly he ſaith [that the Saints are perfect <hi>inchoatively,</hi> and becauſe they goe on more and more; but inchoation and conſummation are two remote terms or ſtations, and progreſſion may ſtand at a great diſtance from perfection and the end of the race, at leaſtwiſe in the beginning and the middle of it. Thirdly, he ſaith [they may be term'd ſo <hi>comparatively,</hi> or in reſpect of other mens unrighteouſneſſe] And fourthly, <hi>acceptatively,</hi> becauſe God accepteth them, though not abſolutely juſt, by the reaſon of manifold ſins and defects, yet in Chriſt and for Chriſt his ſake (through whom all our imperfections are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) as juſt and righteous men.] But by his leave God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts no man, no not in Chriſt, otherwiſe then as he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his preſent inward ſtate and growth: hence it is that the Churches to whom the Apoſtle wrote, and thoſe ſeven eſpecially to whom Chriſt wrote, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, 3, chap.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29469:41"/>are either commended or rebuked, threatned, or encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged according to their obedience or diſobedience, faith or unbeliefe, growth or decay in godlineſſe; and no man is taken for perfect but he that was truly ſo in ſome kind or degree. Yet it is true that the Lord doth for a time, and with much long-ſufferance, tenderneſſe and compaſſion beare the failings of his good-willing ſervants which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ignorance and humane weakneſſe, and not from neglect, and much leſſe from preſumption; yea while men are truly babes in Chriſt he accepts the will for the deed, and expects no more from any men then what they can do by grace attained, or which they might have done by grace at hand, if they had ſought it: Howbeit nothing doth more diſpleaſe him then wilful Apoſtaſie after grace received, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6, 7. and 10.26, 27, 28. and unbelief in his grace and power for the ſubduing of our enemies, after we had experience already of the ſame in ſome meaſure. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. <hi>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had ſinned, whoſe carkaſſes fell in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe? and to whom ſware he that they ſhould not enter into reſt, but to them that beleeved not? ſo we ſee that they could not enter in becauſe of unbeliefe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he brings in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſaying [that <hi>the beſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of man in this life is to confeſſe and acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be imperfect.</hi>] Which is a very raſh and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate affirmation, as many other of his dictates are: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if he had ſaid it had been the high way to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, firſt to know and acknowledge our own imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then for cure to fly to Chriſt, this ſaying had not been ſo imperfect or dangerous. But they that are under the work of the Law, and not yet under the ſaving work of grace, do abundantly know and feel their imperfections: how can this then be mens greateſt perfection to find and feel their imperfections? Such plauſible ſayings without truth are ſoft pillows under ſecure mens arms, inviting them to ſleep in ſlothfulneſſe and ſin. But the Vindicator doth now promiſe to lay down ſome reaſons for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his firſt poſition; of which let us take a view.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29469:41"/>The firſt is this, [That there is not any among the Saints of God mentioned in the Scripture that the Spirit of grace doth not charge with ſome ſin; the moſt perfect in their generations were not without their failings, and that after their long walking with God; as <hi>Noah</hi> being drunk, <hi>Lot</hi> inceſtuous, <hi>Abraham</hi> diffident, when he conſented to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means in going in to <hi>Hagar,</hi> for bringing about Gods purpoſe; <hi>Sarah</hi> lyed and diſtruſted when ſhe laughed at the promiſe of God; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were barred out of <hi>Canaan</hi> for diſhonouring God by diffidence and paſſion; <hi>Hezechiah</hi> was lifted up with pride; <hi>Job</hi> impatient, and humbled for it; <hi>David</hi> had foul and ſecret ſins which he repented of and prayed againſt; <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Aſa</hi> were reproved; <hi>Uzziah</hi> and <hi>Zachariah</hi> puniſhed, one by untimely death, the other by dumbneſs; and yet theſe are reported in the Scripture <hi>to have ſerved God with all their heart.</hi> To which we ſay, that this argument and reaſon hath little of reaſon in it; for, firſt, it is falſe that the Spirit of grace hath charged with ſome particular ſin or other the moſt perfect men in their generation; for neither <hi>Abel</hi> nor any of the Patriarchs before the flood, nor after the flood to <hi>Abraham,</hi> are ſo charged, unleſs <hi>Noah</hi> for one act of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, wherein alſo he was ſurprized by the unknown ſtrength and operation of the new wine. The like we may ſay of <hi>Eleazar, Ithamar, Joſhuah, Caleb, Othniel, Ehud, Jephthah, Samuel, Nathan, Gad,</hi> and almoſt all the prophets; of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and his mother, of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> her husband, of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> and almoſt all the Apoſtles, and thouſands of other Saints mentioned in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and particular in the Scriptures. Secondly, that there neither wants ignorance nor impudence in this his charge: For <hi>Abraham</hi> took <hi>Hagar</hi> by inſtinct of the Spirit, as is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinted in <hi>Mala.</hi> 2.13. which verſe, as <hi>Caſtellio</hi> hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obſerved, ſhould be thus rendred. <hi>If ſo be one did it who had abundance of the Spirit;</hi> (yet wherefore is that one alledged? to wit for the juſtification of <hi>Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>) <hi>who ſought a godly ſeed; therefore take heed to your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and let none of you deal treacherouſly againſt the wife of his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29469:42"/>youth.</hi> Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo tell us that <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> were alſo an Allegorie or myſtery of the two Covenants and Teſtaments? <hi>Gall.</hi> 4.24. But it was once the practiſe of the falſe Apoſtles to <hi>ſpeak evil of thoſe things which they underſtood not, Jude</hi> v. 10. yet this champion of corruption contents not himſelf to accuſe the moſt abſolute pattern of faith and obedience that was to be found among meer men, who is the father of all the faithful, and the friend of God, whom he firſt ſingled out to make him in a ſpecial manner the man of his covenant, and to charge him with unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and diſobedience, and that here the ſecond time, in this his ſlanderous pamphlet: but he likewiſe challengeth and impeacheth <hi>Job</hi> of impatience, who is commended unto us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.11. for a rare pattern of patience, as indeed he was: It were well for him if he had the fourth part of <hi>Abraham's</hi> obedient faith, or <hi>Jobs</hi> patience. But let it be granted that not onely <hi>David,</hi> but others alſo had foul ſins and ſecret ſins for a time, had they ſuch unto their dying dayes? we trow not; being he confeſſeth that he both bewailed them, prayed to have them diſcovered and removed: witneſs the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23, 24. ſaying, <hi>Search me O God, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any ſinful or wicked way in me, and lead me in the way ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> And therefore to little purpoſe he cites [page 30 that paſſage of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who bids the Pelagians in a rhetorical flouriſh, <hi>ask all the Saints, and they will confeſs</hi> (is he ſure of it?) <hi>that while they lived here they were not without ſin.</hi>] But theirs is but one opinion; we ſhall anon ſhew him the contrary ſenſe of ſome not inferiour to him, as we did of late out of 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17, 18. The confeſſion of <hi>John</hi> who was ten times more infallible then <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and all his <hi>African</hi> Biſhops aſſembled together. But he goeth on, and ſaith [if any Saint on earth had to glory, it was with men, and not with God.] So ſay we alſo, yet had all the faithfull Saints cauſe to glory in the Lord for their victory in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. And further he ſaith for his ſecond argument [that we do not read of any Saints that did ſo ſtand, but that they fell into ſome ſins.] Which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29469:42"/>is not true of their final eſtate; and they alſo that had; as he ſaith, defects in their beſt performances; yes, the Lord teſtifieth of <hi>Joſhuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb, that they had fully followed him, Numb.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14.6. and we have proved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary out of many places; and therefore in his ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he wrongeth <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the Text it ſelf when he ſaith [that <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 13.22. prayed <hi>that his good ſervices might be remembred with Gods reward,</hi> and alſo <hi>with his pardon or forgiveneſs;</hi>] for that implies a contradiction, for the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal fignifieth to <hi>ſpare</hi> as well as to <hi>forgive;</hi> and ſo have our Tranſlators rendred it in that place, and that very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuinely, <hi>Remember me O Lord concerning this, and ſpare me according to the greatneſs [or multitude]</hi> of thy mercies; That is, <hi>preſerve me from mine enemies to do thee further ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> But to retain corruption to the laſt breath, the ſaid Champion layeth aſperſion upon the very grace of God, ſaying there that good works do not come from ſuch a pure principle of grace as doth exactly fill the ſoul.] But the Lord ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> And Chriſt alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs for they ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> And again he ſaith expreſly [that in the principle of grace there are ſome defects, and therefore the works flowing from thence are imperfect. Page 31 he ſaith in the ſame lying dialect, [that God reſerves the conſummation of grace, to wit, that whereby ſin ſhould be purged out, and the Law fulfilled by us, unto the ſtate of glory.] True it is in the general which he ſpeaks there, that grace is glory begun and glory is grace conſummate; but not that grace which is called <hi>the laver of regeneration,</hi> and <hi>the renewing of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> for that muſt go before life and glory, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4 5, 6, 7. And though <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect are in heaven,</hi> to wit, in the heaven of Gods holineſs, of which the Prophet ſpeaks <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.15. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 6.17. yet there is a firſt, a ſecond, and a third heaven here beſides the outward heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.23. And that heaven is three-fold as well as the outward heaven, one of calling and converſion, another of juſtification or regeneration, and a third of glorification; and the Saints
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29469:43"/>may be made perfect in the ſecond heaven, as to the final purging out of ſins, and the renewing of Gods image, though in the third heaven we expect the perfection and tranſcendency of glory: <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into the third heaven, but lived conſtantly in the ſecond, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Yea he tels all the believing Saints that were come to have that fellowſhip in ſome meaſure and degree with <hi>the general aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born written in</hi> that <hi>heaven, and with the ſouls of the juſt men made perfect,</hi> to wit, ſome in grace, and ſome in glory; with the former they were upon the way in tendency unto the latter. His third argument is, [that all our graces here are imperfect in this life.] But doth not Saint <hi>James</hi> tell us, that <hi>there are perfect gifts that come down from the father of lights?</hi> chap. 1.17. and <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that <hi>God will perfect his own work in us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. And whereas he ſaith [that theſe three divine graces, faith, hope, and charity, are ſo all our life long:] It is evident, that not onely his charity, but his faith and hope are truely ſuch; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.22. that <hi>by workes Abrahams faith was made</hi> (or declared) <hi>to be perfect;</hi> and if true ſee <hi>John</hi> 1 Epiſt. 4.17. <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and for hope, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And we deſire that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you do ſhew forth the ſame diligence to the full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope unto the end.</hi> The like we might ſhew of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, I will alſo keep thee</hi> (preſerve thee) in this life. But let us hear how he proves theſe three graces to remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies imperfect in us. [For faith (he ſaith) and that truly, muſt be grounded upon knowledge.] And we wiſh his had been ſo, we mean aright underſtanding. [But the Apoſtle tels us (ſaith he) <hi>that we know but in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. ſo that our Saviour may well ſay to the beſt of us as he did to his Diſciples, <hi>O ye of little faith, Matth.</hi> 8.26. and the beſt of us may ſay with him, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord I believe, help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>] But we have proved before that <hi>Abraham's faith,</hi> (whoſe ſteps we ſhould follow, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>was perfect;</hi> and that the Apoſtle <hi>had kept (or fulfilled) the faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29469:43"/>yea that the faith was an eſtate which they had paſſed through and left behind; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. For we (ſaith he) <hi>who have believed do enter into reſt.</hi> Nor is the knowledge of true believers concerning things to be ſought for by faith imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or in part onely; although <hi>the things that God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thoſe that love him,</hi> and which are to be enjoyed in the third heaven, or paradiſe, are here but known in part; for that which Chriſt ſpake to his diſciples is made good to all true believers that ſeek it, <hi>John</hi> 14.4. <hi>Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know:</hi> How can <hi>faith be the ground of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not yet ſeen,</hi> and not yet attained, if it have not a knowledge of them? See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly he ſaith, that which is perfect admits no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.] No more did the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and of many Saints more, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.24.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he ſaith, that our faith ſhall be perfected in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.] But both it and patience muſt be finiſhed ere we can arrive at the third heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. &amp; 10.36. &amp; 12.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Fourthly he ſaith, that <hi>[fides eſt tam apparentium quàm non apparentium.]</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24, 25. <hi>For we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by hope; but hope that is ſeen is not hope, for what a man ſeeth why doth he yet hope for it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, he ſaith, we muſt believe in heaven the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our happineſs, and therefore there is a perfect faith in heaven, becauſe it is grounded upon knowledge.] But as this man underſtands not what faith is, ſo that faith is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experimental knowledge and aſſurance then faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called. <hi>The faith of Gods elect purifieth our hearts here, Acts</hi> 15.9. and through it we muſt be throughly ſanctified ere we can obtain final remiſſion of ſins, or that promiſed inheritance, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Unto whom I now ſend thee to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God, to the intent they may receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ofi ſins, and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Where you may take notice alſo of the power of the will in turning to God after illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating and preventing grace: yea after men have been
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29469:44"/>ſoundly chaſtiſed for ſin by a work of the Law, and afterward comforted from heaven with a hope of mercy to ſalvation witneſſed in their conſciences by the holy Ghoſt: But the words of the Greek Text are commonly miſtranſlated. Concerning the imperfection of hope he ſaith little to the purpoſe, but what he ſaith implieth a contradiction in it ſelfe, and to what he would aſſert alſo; for he ſaith that the Apoſtle compareth hope to <hi>an anchor for the ſoul which is both ſure and ſtedfaſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. and yet this, ſaith he, doth no ways prove our hope to be perfect; for what greater perfection can there be in an anchor then to have it ſure and ſtedfaſt, and to ſtay and preſerve us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all winds and ſtorms of Satan? which he confeſſeth that our hope doth: Nor is it the anchor that reels to and fro, as he abſurdly ſpeaks, but that which lyeth at anchor, or the Ship it ſelfe, but at the diſtance and the whole length of a cable; whence its mobility by the winds and ſtorms doth ariſe, and not from the anchor it ſelfe. And as for charity, he goes about page 32 to prove that it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect all this life long: [Firſt, becauſe our knowledge here is imperfect and but in part. It is, ſaith he, a Maxime among Divines, <hi>tantum ſcimus quantum diligimus,</hi> which he, or ſome others for him, doth Engliſh thus; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect knowledge cannot produce perfect charity.] But though the Engliſh ſaying is true, yet it is not the ſenſe of the Maxime, but rather this; that we have ſo much divine experimental and ſaving knowledge as there is love found in us; that knowledge being always accompanied with a proportionable love: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hereby we know that we love God, if we keep his commandements:</hi> and verſe 4. <hi>he that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his commandements, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> True it is alſo which the Poet ſpeaks, <hi>quod latet ignotum eſt, ignoti</hi> (but not <hi>ignotae,</hi> as he hath it) <hi>nulla cupido,</hi> things ſimply unknown cannot be loved: yet is not our affection always towards men according to our knowledge or acquaintance with them, as he affirms; for knowledge and acquaintance may be without love. But yet it is true alſo which he out of <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>we can neither
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29469:44"/>deſire what we know not, nor enjoy what we love not;</hi> and that we ſhall love God with an abſolute perfection in heaven, becauſe that we ſhall ſo know him, and that with an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge of his goodneſſe.] But this hinders us not from ſo knowing him here as to love him above all, which is the perfection of love here required of us. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaith, [that perfect charity expelleth fear; but there is no Saint here without feare] Yet we have often ſhewed the contrary out of <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17, 18. Thirdly, he ſaith, [that perfect charity expels ſin, which he denys to be exterminable here, becauſe Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>in many things we all offend,</hi> chap. 3.1, 2.] Which is truly ſpoken of <hi>James</hi> of the whole race of our life, not of our final and beſt attainments; for in the ſame verſe Saint <hi>James</hi> deſcribes ſuch a perfect man <hi>qualis invenire poſſet aut debet,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If any man ſin not in a word the ſame is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole body.</hi> But to fortifie his own cauſe, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to diſable the word of Chriſt, ſaying, [<hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that he lay down his life for his friend;</hi> which he ſaith is not yet perfect; for men may doe this out of ambition, and for vain-glorious ends: and therefore, ſaith he, our Saviour doth not bring this to prove the perfection of our love, but of his own toward us, ſo far as might be underſtood by outward apprehenſion.] But there is a life which if he and others would lay down in love to the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and their friends whom they ſhould perfectly love, it would be an undeniable argument of the greateſt and moſt perfect love towards God, and that is not to offer our only ſon with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or our own natural life, but the life of ſin; and and that is the life which he would have us hate and lay down for his ſake, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. nor is there any other life that men can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call theirs but the life of ſin, for the natural life and the ſpiritual life are Gods workmanſhip and gift, but ſo is not ſin. And having thus to his power mutilated the words of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. he goes about likewiſe to doe Chriſt the like ſervice, where our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Ye are my
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29469:45"/>friends if ye doe whatſoever I command you:</hi> of which this <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Burſon,</hi> as if he affected to be herein an Antichriſt, ſaith [This is an hypothetical propoſition, which can never prove his perfection of charity, becauſe we can never be able to perform the condition] Doth Chriſt then give us falſe marks and mock-tokens to try our ſelves by whether we be his friends or no? was not <hi>Abraham</hi> called <hi>the friend of God?</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.8. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.23. and was it not upon this very ſcore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.5. <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> ſtatutes, and my charge? This brought all bleſſings upon <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed after him. But he goes on, ſaying:</p>
               <p>For although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> [ſaith Gods word may be kept, that is, fulfilled; yet he proves it not.] If he did not, he might eaſily have done it; and for to ſay that Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are grievous, and to ſay that we can keep them not, is not the ſame, ſaith he: yes, in the Apoſtles ſenſe they are, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>For this is the love of God that we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and his commandements are not grievous:</hi> and he ſhews the reaſon of it in the two next verſes, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of both the Vindicators poſitions; <hi>for whatſoever is born of God overcometh the world,</hi> to wit, that world of ſin oppoſite to the world of the Father; of which ſinful world he had ſpoken, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</hi> [For a thing, ſaith the Vindicator, may be very light, yet heavier then I can bear.] Surely he is either a very weak man, or this is a ſtrong mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; but how doth he prove it? [<hi>The commandements,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are juſt and holy and good, Rom.</hi> 7.12. and <hi>the yoke</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is <hi>eaſie and light, Matth.</hi> 11.30.] Both theſe are true; but the former of theſe doth not ſpeak any thing of the lightneſſe or heavineſſe of Gods Law, nor yet the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unleſs it be to thoſe that are weary of the yoke of ſin, and come to Chriſt, and learn of him the lowlineſſe and meekneſſe, and all other Chriſtian virtues which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſin, and which enable men to obey that Law. Now whereas he would prove that theſe commandements of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29469:45"/>the moral Law are heavyer then we can bear; he brings out a teſtimony that ſpeaks of the ceremonial Law eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which no man could bear, or fulfill of himſelfe, though it was far lighter then the moral Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not, ſaith he, the priviledge of the Church militant to have no defect or imperfection remaining:] It is true of the Church collectively taken; but we have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſome have ended their warfare here before they goe hence, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.1, 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.13. [Here, ſaith he, we pray, <hi>enter not into judgement with thy ſervants O Lord. O that my ways were ſo directed that I might learn thy ſtatutes. Make me a clean heart O God.</hi>] But doe the Saints pray ſo always to the end of their life? <hi>They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof,</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>and Chriſt only lives in them,</hi> Gal. 2.20.</p>
               <p>[Here, ſaith he, we ſtill find need of Chriſt who is our advocate with God the Father, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.12.] But who are they that need him ſtill as a propitiator or purger out of ſin? for <hi>Ioh.</hi> ſpeaks there to the babes, <hi>My little children;</hi> and yet he ſpeaks to them not to ſin, that is, not to continue in ſin; and for that end he ſets forth a helper of them there againſt ſin: as for <hi>the young men,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that they had overcome the wicked one, Ioh.</hi> 2.13, 14. how much more had the old men ſo done?</p>
               <p>Pag. 34. He tels us [that what he hath before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten may ſuffice to ſatisfie them whoſe eyes <hi>the God of this world hath not blinded;</hi> That ſin will have a being in the beſt of men ſo long as our ſouls have a being in theſe hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of clay:] But we dare conclude, that if any man reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied therewith in that point that his eyes were never yet truly opened <hi>to behold the light of the Goſpel of the glory of Chriſt who is the image of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p>But he prays all the faithful to joyn with him in ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God for his adverſaries, that they may ſee their own ſins.] And ſo doe we alſo for our ſelves, and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally for him and them: yet will not that follow that we
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29469:46"/>ſhall be aſhamed of our doctrine, as he hopes we ſhall; For we have not drawn the ſame from any ſuch puddles as he is pleaſed to call them, to wit, <hi>Pelagius, Bellarmine, Baily, Becanns,</hi> the Jeſuits, or from the Adamites, who conceived that they were renewed to <hi>Adams</hi> firſt purity: unleſſe he will have <hi>the ſecond Adam,</hi> as he cals Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles, to be ſuch Adamites: Nor have we learned them from <hi>Romes</hi> fraternity now crept in amongſt us, who are, as he ſaith, well verſed in the old trade of Arch-here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks (what is that? even his own handicraft;) in falſifying of truth or Text; rather (for the truth may be denyed or abuſed, but not falſified) whatſoever he ſaith to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to maintain lyes. But he doth hope, and ſo doe we alſo, that God will diſcover ſuch in due time (by us or ſome other of his ſervants) and in the interim keep his (who are no patrons for ſin, nor latrons from the due obſervance of Gods Law) by the help of Chriſt, from being ſubverted by them. But he goes on, [what men without ſin?] ſaith he. Yes, the Angel ſhewed <hi>John</hi> many thouſands that had been ſuch upon the earth, as we proved before out of <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. and 14.4, 5, 6. Yea <hi>John</hi> did demonſtrate ſome ſuch unto us before of his own ſociety, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17, 18. and 5.18. But he ſcoffingly ſaith [it was happy for the woman that was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in adultery that her accuſers were not ſuch as theſe preachers.] Why? doe we profeſſe our ſelves to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin? But it will be found our fault, and his alſo, if we live and dye in our ſins, now that there is ſuch <hi>a fountain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem, for ſin and for uncleanneſſe, Zach.</hi> 13.1. And yet it will not follow that if there had been one, yea many ſuch impeccant perſons there (of which none are to be found among the proud and cenſorious Phariſees) that the ſaid delinquent ſhould have had a volly of ſtones about her ears; for who are more ſenſible of humane frailty then ſuch as have paſſed through the ſame? or who are more merciful then ſuch as have obtained mercy to put away all cruelty, pride, and wickedneſſe through the help of Chriſt? yet muſt Chriſts expreſſe commandements be obſerved. But he comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29469:46"/>us with the Apoſtles Creed, ſaying, [What need is there to believe the Article of the forgiveneſſe of ſin, if men may live without ſin?] True, if they could come into this world, live here many years, and goe out again without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin. But if ſin that is once in cannot be purged out again, nor the image of God renewed, nor the Law fulfilled, what need is there to <hi>beleeve in God the Father Almighty maker of Heaven and earth, and in Ieſus Chriſt his only ſon our Lord?</hi> who is called Jeſus, becauſe <hi>he came to ſave his people from their ſins, Mat.</hi> 1.21. and called Chriſt, becauſe <hi>he is anointed for that very work, Iſai.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3, 4. yea why doe we believe that <hi>he is riſen again for our juſtification,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. or in the Holy Ghoſt, that there is an Holy catholick Church whom Chriſt came <hi>to ſanctifie by the waſhing of water through the word that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing? Epeſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Pag. 34, 35. he gives us this advice as a point of good religion; To turn the Lords precepts into prayers, and to ſay with holy <hi>David,</hi> who a little before had his ſecret ſins and his foul ſins, but now is called holy <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 43.3. <hi>Send out O Lord thy light and thy truth, and let them lead me into the holy mountain, and unto thy Tabernacle:</hi> and as is Pſalm 143.10. <hi>Let thy good Spirit lead me into the land of righteouſneſſe.</hi>] To which we ſay, it is a point of good religion indeed, for as the whole duty of man, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Solomon,</hi> conſiſts herein, to wit, <hi>in fearing God and keeping his commandements, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. So his father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> made the 119 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which is the longeſt meditation extant in the whole book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> a devout prayer for grace to underſtand and fulfill Gods Commandements; and left it to the Church as an holy Alphabet to know their duty both of prayer and obedience thereby.</p>
               <p>But would the Vindicator have men pray in faith or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe? for if the thing be not poſſible to be had in this life, they cannot pray for it in faith; and if it is attainable, his ſecond poſition fals to the ground: And if Gods <hi>light and truth muſt lead us into the mountain or tabernacle of his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29469:47"/>righteouſneſſe,</hi> then all ſin muſt be left behind, and ſo his firſt poſition is overthrown likewiſe. And here is another of his contradictions, yea a twin, or a double one.</p>
               <p>But to this his advice he joyns his new Letany (to which we fay Amen;) And from blind Jeſuiticall guides with their falſe pretended new lights in a dark Lanthorn, their feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edlies, pretended revelations, but deluſions, <hi>Good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us.</hi>] But who pretends to new lights, or inſiſts upon extraordinary revelations? or who hath a darker lanthorn then himſelfe? or what Jeſuit uſeth the trade of lying ſo often as he doth? in which conflict its now known he himſelf would carry away the whetſtone: So that if <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> came at noon-day again with his lanthorn, either to find truth in his aſſertions, or common honeſty in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them, he would <hi>operam &amp; oleum perdere.</hi> Note alſo that here again he cals us Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>But he is pleaſed to ſalute us at the table, ſaying [much good may their perfection on earth doe them, ſure we are that if we can attain it, it will doe us no harm] But by way of return we ſay, well may he fare with his much affected imperfections and corruption; <hi>ſimilis lactuca labris:</hi> but Chriſt alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. ſaith, <hi>he that is unjuſt let him be unjuſt ſtill, and he that is filthy let him be filthy ſtill; but he that is juſtified let him be juſtified ſtill, and he that is ſanctified let him be ſanctified ſtill:</hi> for what a man moſt affects in theſe things, that ſhall be his portion in the end. Howbeit with his lips or pen he begs to have his imperfections diſcovered, and to be humbled in the ſenſe of them ſo long as he liveth (as if the Lord delighted more in our dejectment for them, then ejectment of them;) that he may cry always with the poor Publican; but doth he beg healing and cleanſing mercies, that he might offend no more, or only pardon for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <hi>toties quoties</hi> committed, and ſo to end his days? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhould then have been but a poor Publican in the end, though he had a rich office. But he will alſo (at leaſtwiſe in words) make an emulator of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>forgat what was behind and preſſed forward towards the mark,</hi> and put forth, (we wiſh he means not quite out of doors,) all the ſtrength
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29469:47"/>that the Lord ſhall pleaſe to ſend him, and improving all opportunities to the beſt advantage for the mortifying of all ſinfull corruptions in him, and for the growing in grace, untill <hi>he attaines unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> But leſt all this ſhould be had too ſoon in the world (but here by the miniſtery of the word the work is to be carried on even to perfection, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.) he contradictingly ſaith, [which ſhall be after grace conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate hereafter in heaven,] and ſo deſperately concludes, [As for him that can find perfection here on earth, let him never look for it in heaven.] As if it could not be had in both places or eſtates in ſeveral degrees; contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> hope, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith, I have finiſhed my courſe; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> Doth not the holy Ghoſt ſay, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. that <hi>thoſe that die</hi> (here to ſin) <hi>in the Lord, that they may reſt from their own works and labours,</hi> (as the fourth commandement requires) <hi>that their works ſhall follow them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the laſt place he tels us, that he will lay down ſome of our arguments, and ſome Scriptures which we wreſt to maintain them.] Wherein he ſhews himſelf a better divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then a divine; for he had none of them as yet from us, unleſs thoſe which he findeth in the argument of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Draytons</hi> ſermons, of which he mentioneth very few. Firſt he ſaith [that we deny original ſin.] Which thing in his ſenſe is true: But we ſay every mans firſt fall is his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſin. Secondly, we ſay (as he tels you) that original ſin is taken away from the Saints on earth;] we ſay that it either is, or ought to be, there being ſufficient grace and help offered and afforded in Chriſt to us for that end: [and therefore that ſuch mortified Saints cannot derive it to their poſterity.] What is this to the queſtion in hand? yet we confeſs more, that neither the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any parent deſcended from him, can convey any ſuch ſtain of ſinfull corruption by generation to their children; becauſe a moſt holy God creates both ſoul and body innocent and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin. But as this argument of his is none of ours, ſo his ſolution or anſwer is a meer figment of mans brain; for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29469:48"/>he ſaith [there are three things in ſin, the offence, the guilt, and the pollution, or ſtain, being an inclination to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like ſins: Of which (ſaith he) the two firſt are taken away; but the laſt, which is the worſt, is left behind during this life.] Where ye may take notice of theſe abſurdities or contradictions: Firſt, that Gods hates the offence, as he ſaith, in his deareſt Saints; and, as he ſaith, it is aboliſhed and blotted out by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: If it be aboliſhed (as he ſaith it is) how can it remain in them ſtill? and if it remain ſtill, how can it be but hatefull to God? For the ſecond, the guilt or obligation to puniſhment he ſaith that is pardoned; but, as we have often ſhewed, no ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned till its left and forſaken, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. As for the third, the pollution, which he cals the pure eſſence of ſin. (a very pure eſſence indeed if one look well upon it) [that (ſaith he) doth not reign in a regenerate man; yet the life and being of ſin is not taken away, page 36. But he cites a Text there, wherewith he cuts his own throat, if rightly rendred, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. <hi>Who is propitious to all thine iniquities, and healeth all thine infirmities, or diſeaſes.</hi>] The latter words explaining the former; and certainly where diſeaſes are healed they are wholly removed or taken away, they leave no life nor being behind them; and then follows <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>who redeemeth thy life from deſtruction, and crowneth thee with loving kindneſs and mercy:</hi> for where any life or being of ſin is left there is ſo much deſtruction or condemnation left alſo, as we ſhewed out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. True it is that the Lord doth heal our ſouls gradually, as this puny <hi>Emperick</hi> ſpeaks; but he leaves not (we ſay) the full perfecting of the cure to the life of glory, or yet to the hour of death. But page 36. he feigneth a ſecond objection of ours, and then forgeth an anſwer for it, as he did before: [Regenerate parents cannot convey the guilt of original ſin to their children, becauſe to themſelves it is pardoned.] Which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is a ſtrong barre againſt him, though not made by us: And upon this ſcore the guilt of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin after his perſonal repentance could not be charged upon his poſterity. But he ſaith by way of anſwer, [that they are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29469:48"/>freed from the guilt of ſin, and have righteouſneſs imputed unto them by grace, and not by nature; but by nature they have in them original corruption, and therefore they can leave the latter, though not the former:] But we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before that corruption and guilt as well as grace are all ſpiritual and preternatural things, and paſs not to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity by procreation. In the ſame page he ſaith, [that grace and juſtification are not tyed to carnal propagation:] no more are original ſin and condemnation, but to the moſt ſure election of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. in <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>) But as he underſtands not what the election of grace is on which juſtification depends, ſo hath he no diſcerning of that <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to which <hi>Paul</hi> relates <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. yet are they both clearly ſet forth in the Scriptures; the former 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. He hath alſo a third argument to prove that infants have ſin, [becauſe they are liable to death, and <hi>ſtipendium peccati mors,</hi> Rom. 6.33.] But it were well for ſinners if there were not another, and that an everlaſting death, that is the juſt recompence of ſin, as we ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: as for corporal death, it being but a temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the moſt, it might be by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin brought upon all his poſterity, yet without any infection of ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he ſaith there, and page 37. [That infants want not the faculty of will by which they are inclined to ſin, though they do not ſin in act.] Which evill inclination we have denied and diſproved before, with the affirmation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered upon <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> by him, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was not one perſonal ſin, <hi>In uno univerſi;</hi> but this one is our perſonal <hi>Adam.</hi> And therefore it is a falſe charge to ſay that the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was his handwriting that made al his poſterity debters unto God, unleſs in ſome temporal evils inflicted on them for his ſake, as we ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>He tels you likewiſe, but with his wonted lying and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, [that we ſay concupiſcence without conſent unto it is no ſin.] But we ſay the firſt motion to adultery, or any other ſin ariſing from mens or Satans immediate tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is no ſin till ſome titillation or liking of the ſame
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29469:49"/>follows. And though <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Coſter</hi> ſeem to ſpeak ſo of original concupiſcence it ſelf; we deny it, nor do we approve that ſaying of that Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> (who as he ſaith, have as many curſes as Canons) that the Catholick Church never counted concupiſcence truly ſo called ſin in the regenerate; for we do count it no better till it be mortified: And they in effect grant ſo much, ſaying, <hi>it comes from ſin, and tends to ſin.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> cals it expreſly <hi>ſin, Rom.</hi> 7. where the Vindicator confeſſeth that he was ſometimes captivated by it againſt his will. And did it not then reign as a tyrant over him? And is tyranny devoid of dominion and power where it bears ſway, and takes men captive? True it is alſo that the Vindicator ſaith in the general, [that the law condemneth ſin (to wit, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting way, as we ſaid before) as well in the branch as the root:] But that prohibition, <hi>there ſhall not be in thine heart an evil thought againſt the Lord thy God,</hi> doth onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us from allowance of ſuch, for we cannot hinder Satan from ſuggeſting ſuch unto us; nor was Chriſt upon earth wholly free from ſuch injectments. And that which the Vindicator page 30 ſaith of the motions of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, is true; but both he and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf are foully miſtaken if they think that all ſinfull motions come from concupiſcence: yet it is true in ſome ſenſe which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> there ſaith, <hi>It were better to have none then to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them.</hi> True, it were better for the mans eaſe and ſafety to have no temptations; but it is better for his exerciſe, and more for his glory (if the Lord will have it ſo) to have ſuch, and overcome them, then not to be exerciſed at all therewith.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Bernard</hi>'s ſaying, take it ſingle without the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicators double dealing in the end or concluſion, and it makes againſt his poſition and ſcope; which ſaying is this: <hi>[That kind of ſin which ſo often troubles us, I mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and evill deſires, may and ſhould be ſuppreſſed by the grace of God, ſo that it reign not in us, and that we give not our members weapons of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin; and that way there is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt.]</hi> For this is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29469:49"/>the ſumme of what we ſay, and therein he directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf; and this the Vindicator obſerving, adds this clauſe [yet it is not caſt out but in death.]</p>
               <p>Having in the two laſt pages made an impertinent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion to prove againſt the Papiſts that concupiſcence is ſin, and page 39 and the two following, he, comes in his erratick and wandring way to viſit the Pelagians, who, as he tels us page 39. were condemned in many Councels ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned and gathered together for the confutation (he ſhould have rather ſaid for the cenſuring) of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Caeleſtius</hi> their hereſies, about the year 420, and ſome years after; as in the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Councel, the Councel of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and the Councel of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> in the Eaſt: ſome of whoſe objections (with which we have nothing to do) he, to fill up his empty book like an empty ſhop with rols of painted wares, produceth and anſwereth them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſolutions, ſo ſolutive is he at this preſent: As firſt, [that concupiſcence becauſe it is a natural propenſion to things forbidden by the Law, is no ſin. To which he anſwers, that our natural concupiſcence and deſires are now inordinate and ſinfull, which they were not before the fall: the like he anſwereth to our affections and appetites to deſire good, and eſchew evil things, which as long as they are not carried to forbidden objects, or immoderately, are not exorbitant or ſinful.] And ſo ſay we; <hi>ſed quid hoc ad Rhombum?</hi> But page 40 he brings a ſecond objection of theirs, and a third, and fourth; the ſecond is this, [That which is not in our power to cauſe it to be, or not to be, is no ſin: but concupiſcence is not in our power to ſhake off, therefore it is no ſin. Unto which he anſwereth ſomething that is true, and ſomething that is falſe. As firſt, that ſin is to be eſteemed by the will and Law of God thereagainſt.] Which is true; But this is not ſo, where he ſaith that God requiring of us impoſſible things doth not injure us, becauſe he commanded them when they were poſſible.] But this is not onely injurious to us without grace offered, but inconſiſtent with Gods juſtice and goodneſs alſo. The third objection is this, [Sin makes men obnoxious to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29469:50"/>wrath of God: but concupiſcence in the regenerate doth not; for there is no condemnation (ſay they) to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus, though they have concupiſcence left in them.] Wherein take notice that the Vindicator that cals us <hi>Pelagians</hi> is herein a <hi>Pelagian</hi> himſelfe, as all his fellows are. Secondly, that whereas he ſhould deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> that concupiſcence doth not make the regenerate obnoxious to Gods wrath, he admits it, and takes it for granted, that neither that nor any other ſin doth condemn the regenerate, or make them obnoxious to Gods wrath: and yet he confeſſeth them to be ſins; but ſaith, that by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident it cometh to paſs that they are not reputed for ſuch, but are pardoned by grace.] Which is true when they are repented of and left, and ſo ceaſe to be ſins; but not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The fourth objection which he brings is this, [In bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme original ſin is taken away; therefore concupiſcence is no ſin in thoſe that are baptized. Uunto which he anſwers by diſtinction, yet without the leaſt inſtinct of truth, that by baptiſme the guilt of ſin is taken away.] Which we deny againſt ſome of the Fathers and the Schoolmen, as having no warrant from the Scriptures. But he confeſſeth [that the worſt part of ſin, and that which is moſt offenſive to God, remaineth, even corruption, and an inclination to ſin.] But here we firſt ſay, that the guilt is not taken away before or without the corruption. Secondly, that children when they are baptized have neither guilt nor corruption to be taken away for the preſent, yet may lawfully be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in innocency, as Chriſt himſelf was, for a future do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument and ſign. And thirdly, that in the baptiſme of men grown, and newly converted, neither the acts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, nor the guilt are taken away by outward baptiſme; only there is their duty in following of Chriſt in his death and reſurrection, under the hope of his grace and help for the preſent, and of a full remiſſion and eternal life in the end declared unto them therein; by which alſo they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and fulfill an outward ordinance, oblige themſelves to the ſaid duty, ſtand under that grace hoped for, and are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29469:50"/>diſtinguiſhed by an holy ordinance and Chriſtian profeſſion from other men. Pag 41. he firſt concludes [that original concupiſcence is ſin.] Which we never denyed: and then he is ſo impudent as to ſay of us, [that were not theſe men paſt ſhame, they would never goe about to revive ſuch he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies as we hoped had been long ſince buried among us] But who revived them, he, or we? But mark his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> there. [But ſo long as there is a Divell in hell, or a Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> we muſt never expect to be freed from ſuch diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our peace.] But what diſturbance have we made, or what peace have we broken? Thus he that hath played the <hi>boutefeu</hi> himſelfe, and hath without cauſe incenſed all the neighbouring Miniſters and people againſt us where he could get acceſs and audience, chargeth us with his own wicked practiſe of diſturbance, who live quietly, and cauſe no commotion amongſt men, but only ſeek to awaken them out of ſecurity and ſloth, to watch, and war aright againſt their ſins and Ghoſtly enemies, and that out of love to God and their ſouls, and in order to their everlaſting peace as well as their preſent welfare, <hi>in the unity of the Spirit and the bond of perfection,</hi> which is love to God and men, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of ſin, and the fulfilling of the Law. But we muſt bear his falſe charge and challenge in this kind with the more meekneſs, becauſe the holy Prophets and Apoſtles have undergone the like accuſation at the hands of injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſlanderous, and outragious men, and that upon the ſelf-ſame account, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.21. and 18.13. and 24.5. and as long as there is a Devil in hell, and his helliſh kingdom hath room in mens hearts, <hi>and ſets their tongues on fire,</hi> as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks chap. 3.6. we muſt expect no better uſage at their hands, till the old <hi>accuſer of our brethren be caſt ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29469:51"/>divers of them we have not yet produced; nor have we need to wreſt thoſe that we alledge, for they ſpeak that clearly which we would prove. [The firſt, ſaith he, is that <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the Chriſtians who are baptized into the faith of Chriſt, <hi>knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin may be deſtroyed;</hi> from thence (ſaith he) they conclude that the corruption of old <hi>Adam</hi> is quite aboliſhed, that they are perfectly quitted from ſin, and perfectly renewed in grace.] But this is one of his forged lies; for we neither cite that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor inferr any ſuch thing from it: but ſince he by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation hath quoted it for us, we ſhall without wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it conclude that thoſe which truly confeſs the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith and baptiſme, both may and ought to be crucified with Chriſt, and through his grace and help to deſtroy the whole body of ſin; and ſo we have promiſed by our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to doe, when we were baptized, unleſſe we will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negadoes with him: Unto this Scripture he anſwers pag. 42 as he had done before, without fear or wit, truth, or modeſty, [that the guilt of ſin which the Schools term <hi>the formal of ſin</hi> (but indeed is the fruit and effect of ſin) is taken away in baptiſme.] The falſhood of which we have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the baptiſme which he meaneth neither takes away the guilt nor corruption of ſin; for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized among the other Samaritans, and yet was ſtill <hi>in the gall of bitterneſſe and bond of iniquity, Acts</hi> 8.20. Secondly, as to the corruption, he ſaith, [that the dominion of it is taken away, but not the being of ſin, from Gods Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit;</hi> and the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelfe, <hi>I ſee another Law in my members warring againſt the Law of my mind, and carrying me captive unto the Law of ſin which is in my members.</hi>] But we ſhewed before that the infant-ſtate of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new-born babes in Chriſt, is not the full ſtrength and ſtature of young men in Chriſt, and much leſſe the dayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of old men, or elders, and experienced ſouldiers or Saints in Chriſt. Secondly, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not there of his own preſent condition. And thirdly, that this Text
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29469:51"/>flies in his and their faces who affirm that all dominion of ſin is taken away from ſuch babes; for this ſin is a prince and a Tyrant, it is not our ſlave, but makes us its ſlave. But he adds this, [that the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>let not ſin be in your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bodies,</hi> but <hi>let it not reign.</hi>] Which is true in regard of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſinful motions, as we ſaid before; but not of <hi>the old leaven of corruption which muſt be purged out,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (though it pleaſeth his tooth well) for which he commendeth it, is falſe, that ſin and concupiſcence is taken away by baptiſme, <hi>non ut non ſit, ſed ut non obſit, not that it ſhould ceaſe to be, but that it ſhould not hurt us,</hi> nor hinder our attainment of everlaſting happineſſe:] For as long as ſin remaineth in us, bringing forth the works of the fleſh, ſpoken of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21. it will barr us from entring into Gods kingdom. See there and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. yea, <hi>for ſuch doth the wrath of God fall upon the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, Ephe.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5, 6. Here he brings in the ſaying of <hi>Anſelme</hi> alſo to ſecond <hi>Auguſtine; Not that our in-bred corruption ſhould of a ſudden be conſumed in our fleſh</hi> (who ſaid that it could be ſo conſumed?) <hi>that liveth, but that it ſhould not be imputed when we are dead.</hi>] To which we ſay, that if we be dead unto it in conformity with Chriſt it ſhal not be imputed unto us, but if we live and die in it, it ſhal be charged upon us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, inſtead of citing the ſecond place of Scripture, which he fathers upon our quotation, he heaps up three, ſome wherof have ſmall affinity with each other. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>How ſhall we who are dead to ſin live any longer therein? Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Wherefore my brethren ye are become dead to the Law.</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>The Law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus hath freed me from the Law of ſin and death.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. Unto which laſt place he rather alludes then expreſly refers us, ſaying, [that a regenerate man is renewed in all things throughout in every part and power, both of body and ſoul; and therefore the regenerate are quite freed from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſin, and indued with all perfection of grace. But in theſe allegations he abuſeth us; for firſt, we have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged any of them heretofore to maintain our poſitions.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:29469:52"/>
               <p>Secondly, that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. ſpeaks of a freedome or dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Law in its compulſive work, and not of being dead to ſin; and though we might and ſhall conclude from <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. and 8.2. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15, 17. that the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate may and ought to be ſo dead to ſin, freed from the law of ſin and death, and ſo renewed, yet we doe not ſay that they all are ſo perfected, or can be ſo on the ſudden; but in due time they may and ſhall be ſo, even in this life, if they quit themſelves aright. Howbeit page 43. he comes to anſwer theſe and the like places which ſpeak of a totall death unto ſin, and a renewing of Gods image, with his old diſtinction [that it may be done <hi>inchoatively</hi> (which is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the leaſt infant or babe in Chriſt, I ſpeak of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ones) but not pefectively or fully. [Surely he is wont to cure his patients but <hi>inchoativè</hi> at the moſt, or elſe, if he do it <hi>perfectivè,</hi> he will in his way put down Chriſt, according to his doctrine. But ſaith he, [the Spirit of God by theſe forms or phraſes would teach us two ſpecial things, (what be thoſe?) Firſt, that ſin is now like a ſerpent cruſhed in the head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. which, ſaith he, can never recover his former ſtrength, nor any ways hurt the regenerate man, but only to bruiſe his heel, that is, by the wrigling of her tail to bring ſome temporary affliction upon him. But when was ſin ſo cruſhed? by baptiſme? was it ſo cruſhed in <hi>Simon Magus?</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> tels the Romans that Satan the worker in and with them was yet to be bruiſed for the preſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>and the God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> and was afraid that he might through his ſubtilty deceive and ſeduce the Corinthians from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. Secondly, that it ſhould be the main ſcope of the Saints to ſtrive continually to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the fleſh, and to doe their beſt endeavours to be clean rid of them, and <hi>to perfect holineſs in the fear of God:</hi> and this, ſaith he, is plainly intimated unto us in all the exhortations of the Scriptures; as where it is ſaid, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fleſhly luſts; and mortifie the deeds of the body,</hi> and the like.] But firſt, thoſe places, or ſome of them, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16, 17. doe ſhew us that the work was done
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29469:52"/>already; and both thoſe and others incite as to ſet upon the work vigorouſly and under hope, to effect it with hope: which he denies. And thirdly, we are by thoſe exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are indeed expreſs commands from the Lord, (whatſoever he or <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith to the contrary) enjoyned to labour after ſuch a riddance from ſin, and perfection in holineſſe, not by our own endeavours alone, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating the help of Chriſt, or elſe we ſhall effect little in in the buſineſſe; which makes many unfruitful. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he adds very impertinently, though pertinaciouſly enough; [If there were no luſts nor deeds of the fleſh in us (yes, there are too many till they be ſubdued) to what end are we bid to mortifie them?] To which we will ſuperad this, that if they cannot be killed and ſlain, why are we commanded to mortifie or kill them, as we are often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to doe? Then he comes to a third Scripture of ours (as he cals it) which he ſaith he had quoted before, to wit, that in the ſecond place, but we reſerve it for this; where he takes upon him to anſwer it after his wonted manner: the place is 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin, becauſe his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Unto which he anſwers two ways, firſt more largely, and then more briefly, but neither way to the purpoſe; for he underſtands not of what ſort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, not of babes, or young men, but of ſuch old men in Chriſt as with himſelfe and his fellow-Apoſtles <hi>had the love of God perfected in them,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17, 18. But let us hear what thoſe his anſwers are: [Firſt, he ſaith that they, to wit, the regenerate, do not ſin unto death, for they doe not wholly forſake God; howbeit they may ſin againſt their conſciences (and ſuch, ſaith <hi>Paul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves, Rom.</hi> 14.20, 21.) but they retain ſome beginnings (he ſhould ſay ſeeds) of true godlineſſe, by which as by ſpatks they are ſtirred again to repentance.] But here firſt he ſeems to contradict what he had ſaid pag. 24. by the firſt account, that the Holy Ghoſt withdraws as he is grieved, driven away and quenched by ſuch ſins, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.30. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. then men are blind and wander, as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29469:53"/>ſome ſuch regenerate ones may wholly forſake God, as we ſhewed out of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29, 30. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. Secondly he anſwereth [that he ſinneth not as he is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but in his unregenerate part, or as he is unregenerate.] But ſo do even the unregenerate ſin in that part and manner, and yet they ſin to death, or elſe they could not periſh. But he confeſſeth againſt himſelf [that ſin ſomtimes reigneth in the regenerate, which thing he had denied before: And then he brings in <hi>John,</hi> as he hath done often, to prove that all have ſin in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. which is his miſtake of the place that he underſtands not; for <hi>John</hi> doth not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his meaning better <hi>ver.</hi> 10. but at the firſt of the next chapter writes even to the babes not to ſin, as we have ſhewed. But he will give us his ſenſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. whoſe words are theſe; <hi>If we acknowledge our ſins he is faithful to forgive us:</hi> This therefore, ſaith he pag. 44. is the meaning of Saint <hi>John,</hi> that the regenerate do ſin, but make not much of their ſin; or they doe not ſet open the door, or yield to evil deſires ſo as to caſt off all love to godlineſſe, and not to repent. But we have ſhewed the contrary even now, and might doe further out of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43, 44, 45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27, 28. or more briefly, becauſe, as he tels us (yet with more words, but to as little purpoſe) that he which is born of God makes not a trade of ſinning, he lives not in his ſin, he fancies not his ſin, he delights not in his ſin, he ſins not with purpoſe, with pleaſure, with malice, with perſeverance; ſin reigneth not, but (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>the evill that I doe I would not doe.</hi>] And cannot ſome of them that are yet unregenerate, or but under the work of the Law at the furtheſt, ſay ſo likewiſe? we know who ſaid, <hi>Video meliora probo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>, Deteriora ſequor.</hi> But here he brings the latter part of that verſe 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. by way of objection, <hi>His ſeed remaineth in him, neither can he ſin becauſe he is born of God.</hi> To which he gives his former anſwer, that he ſins nor unto death.] But is not this to adde to the word that is written our own words, and ſo to come under that curſe? <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. Then he brings in a fourth Scripture of our alledging, as he pretends, to wit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29469:53"/>
                  <hi>being born anew not of mortal, but of immortal ſeed, by the word of God who liveth for ever.</hi> From whence he ſaith, that we conclude, that ſince this immortal ſeed never dieth in them that are born of it, they ever remain regenerate, retain grace, and never fall into ſin.] But as this objection is here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, impertinent, and upon a new head or point of doctrine, ſo his anſwer is ſuitable, and falſe alſo into the bargain, to wit, that the regenerate may and do loſe grace and the holy Spirit of God in regard of ſome gifts, and thoſe ſometimes more and fewer; but not in reſpect of all the gifts, for ſtill there remaineth in them ſome print of faith and converſion, which yet by yielding to evil inclinations and deſires is ofttimes ſo oppreſt and darkened, that it can neither be known to others, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm themſelves of the grace of God and their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the preſent; howbeit, ſaith he, it ſuffers them not wholly to forſake God and the known truth, or the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſts merits by faith: ſo <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10, 11. <hi>Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me, and reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation.</hi>] But was this by vertue of the old ſeed of grace, when <hi>David</hi> had been long in his ſins of Adultery and murder without any true repentance for them, or by <hi>Nathan</hi>'s coming unto him to call him to repentance? Therefore his concluſion from thence page 45 is not conſequent, to wit, [that <hi>David</hi> had not wholly left cleanneſs of heart, righteouſneſs of Spirit, nor the way of ſalvation, becauſe then he would not have asked them afreſh of God, as he doth.] For though ſome cleanneſs of heart and rectitude of ſpirit might remain in him, yet he had wholly forfeited and loſt the joy of Gods ſalvation. Secondly, he further anſwereth, that the ſeed of God, which is his word working true faith and converſion, abideth and dieth not.] Concerning their converſion, he means a new and final perſeverance, however they may fall often grievouſly and foully before the end, becauſe <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. <hi>If they had been of us they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with us.</hi>] But we have proved the contrary before out of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.11, 12. unto which adde 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>holding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29469:54"/>faith and a good conſcience, which ſome having put away, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the faith have made ſhipwrack:</hi> and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. and 2.17, 18. &amp; 4.14, 15.</p>
               <p>In the 45 page he brings out other Scriptures as produced againſt him by us; and in the fift place that of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.18. <hi>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.</hi> To which he anſwers [that it cannot as it is a good tree (which ſhall ſo come to paſs in the life to come,) but as it is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and partly evil it may bring forth evil fruit; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (ſaith he) we have ſufficient trial and experience in this life.] Muſt we then bring forth no good fruit here? But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whether the tree fall to the north, or to the ſouth, in the place where it falleth there it ſhall lie,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.3. and <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 91.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh as the palm tree, he ſhall grow as the Caedar in Lebanon; thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God, they ſhall bring forth much fruit in old age, they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing; to ſhew that the Lord is upright, he is my rock, and there is no unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſixth Scripture he undertakes to anſwer, which we ſhall truly own as alledged by Doctor <hi>Drayton</hi> in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is this, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. but it ſeemeth the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was afraid to recite the words, as being too full and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident againſt his poſition and purpoſe, which are theſe; <hi>Hu bands love your wives as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word, and might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Concerning which he ſaith [This Text ſhews us how Chriſt in this life, by the word and Sacrament, and by the operation of grace doth cleanſe us, that in the ſtate of glory we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy without ſpot or wrinkle.] But how proves he that this muſt be then done, and not before? This, ſaith he, I ſhall prove by theſe enſuing reaſons; [Firſt, becauſe here we know but in part, and conſequently can love but in part:] But we have proved that by and in the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it is promiſed that ſuch a meaſure of knowledge is to had (if ſought for) that <hi>men ſhall not need to ſay, know the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29469:54"/>Lord, for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt to the greateſt,</hi> Jer. 31.32, 33. and <hi>that the knowledge of the Lord ſhall abound like as the waters cover the ſea, Eſay</hi> 11.9. His ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, [that if grace were conſummate in this life there ſhould be no difference between the ſtate of grace and of glory.] Yea, grace may here be conſummate in his degree, and that in a very high one, and yet fall ſhort of that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent meaſure which ſhall be attained in the life to come, What ſaith <hi>Paul? Phil.</hi> 1.21. <hi>for me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi> His third reaſon is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> [all the Saints on earth have ſin remaining in them; and they that deny it <hi>are liars, and have no truth in them.</hi>] Yet we do deny that all Saints muſt (while they are upon earth,) have ſin remaining in them; and have a greater Divine then Mr. <hi>John Tendring</hi> to warrant us, even the holy Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> upon whoſe teſtimony (which he underſtands not) he ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly and confidently relieth: See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. &amp; 5.4, 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15, 17. &amp; 14.3, 4, 5. before often cited. Yet we are not ſuch liars as he is notoriouſly known to be, and we hope have more truth in us then he and his book ſet forth.] But he adds, [that all the Fathers againſt the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> underſtand this place.] Which if it were true (as it is not) the <hi>Novatians</hi> may convince them to be Novices, not Fathers; and the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> evict them to be Dotiſts or Dotards: for the Scriptures ſhew clearly that we muſt or ought to be ſuch before, and for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the kingdome of glory. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Who ſhall alſo confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 10.11. <hi>That ye may be pure, and without offence in the day of Jeſus Chriſt, being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23. <hi>And I pray God that your ſpirit, ſoul, and body, may be preſerved blameleſs untill the coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.14. <hi>Wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſeeing ye look for ſuch things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs.</hi> But he ſaith [it is the Church triumphant, and not the Church militant, that muſt be found without ſpot or wrinkle.] Yet the Church of <hi>Smyrna, Rev.</hi> 2. and much more the Church of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29469:55"/>
                  <hi>Philadelphia, Rev.</hi> 3. do appear to be ſuch here, becauſe Chriſt himſelf <hi>who ſearcheth the hearts and reines, Rev.</hi> 2.23. and who finds fault with five of the aforeſaid Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and upon occaſion rebukes them ſharply, finds not the leaſt fault with theſe, but commends them highly; and that may alſo be in ſome ſenſe a triumphant Church who hath upon earth gotten victory over all her enemies, and in that behalf triumpheth with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.33, 39.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh place, he brings 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by himſelf, where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have fought a good fight, and finiſhed my courſe:</hi> which he fortifieth againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as if it were not of ſufficient ſtrength by it ſelf for him to oppoſe: which Text the Vindicator will not obſerve, nor the other place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>but I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt when I have preached unto others I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi>] To both which he anſwers page 46 as he was wont to do, without truth or judgment; [Firſt, that <hi>Paul</hi> fought a good fight, being now ready to be offered up; but that conflict was yet to come ſaith he, not ſo as to obtain exact perfection of grace, and to be without all inherent ſin, of which he complaineth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.] Yes, he was even at that time of his complaint <hi>freed from the Law of ſin and death,</hi> as we have often ſhewed out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. and that long before he was to be ſo offered up. He tels us alſo, (but we know not to what purpoſe) [that <hi>Peter</hi> was led where he would not.] But ſurely it was not into ſin, <hi>John</hi> 21.18. Thirdly, he ſaith [<hi>Paul</hi> kept the faith, and he who ſaid unto him, <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee, and my power is perfected in weakneſs,</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to overcome, though he had corruptions remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, and the buffetings of Satan.] But doth the man underſtand what he ſaith? It is the office of faith to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the heart from ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2, 3. which faith <hi>Paul</hi> did not onely keep and retain, but fought the good fight of faith till the battel was ended, and ſo finiſhed his race and courſe in that kind in dying to ſin; yet he juſtly expected that promiſed reward of which he ſpeakes <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. As to the ſecond Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29469:55"/>he ſaith [that <hi>Paul</hi> kept down his body by faſting and prayer, to bring it into ſubjection.] But was this the body of fleſh and blood, or the inordinate deſires of the ſinful fleſh? He tels us alſo [that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did uſe faſting, prayers and tears to the ſame end.] But he did it not in the faith of Chriſts aſſiſtance, and the hope of final victory, of which it ſeems he deſpaired here: and <hi>James</hi> ſhews that if we would obtain, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6. <hi>we muſt him ask in faith, nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like the waves of the ſea, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the eighth place, he brings a ſecond Scripture, of which Doctor <hi>Drayton</hi> had made uſe in his ſermon, and theſe two are all that he can call his; it is taken out of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. from verſe 10 to 15. <hi>And he gave ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome paſtors and teachers, for the perfecting of the work of the miniſtry, and for the edifying the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfest man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> Unto this he anſwereth after the old mode ignorantly and intricately [Firſt, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the word is given not onely to convert men from ſin, but to perfect men in holineſs,] Then it muſt either effect that for which God hath deſigned it, or elſe the Lord was miſtaken in chuſing and uſing too weak inſtruments. But he adds, yet ſo as the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. [<hi>Which is able to build you up,</hi> that is, to edifie and build the Saints more and more.] Where firſt he underſtands not that word of Gods grace which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of there; for it is the eſſential word which is almighty, not onely able to build us up to perfection, but afterwards to give us an inheritance among them that are ſanctified. Secondly, he contradicts himſelf, becauſe this is able to build us up to the uttermoſt in the way of ſanctification, that we may be fittted for that inheritance. Thirdly, that fitting muſt alſo go before in this life, therefore the two things following are falſe, and his, are his old picklocks: for firſt he ſaith, [though the Saints do grow up under the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet it is not to the attainment of an exact obedience in this life, to be without ſin in this life, and to have grace
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29469:56"/>conſummate; but they grow <hi>and edifie one another in love.</hi>] But we ſpeak not here what the Saints do actually, but what they may and ought to do; nor of their mutual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each other, but of the words deſign and abilitie to build them up to the top, or the finiſhing of the edifice; for a skilful and a faithful builder gives not over till the ſtructure is finiſhed. Secondly he ſaith [that <hi>the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt</hi> is attained onely in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.] Which in his ſenſe is falſe; for here we may have a perfection of <hi>degrees</hi> as well as of <hi>parts,</hi> to wit the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſanctification or grace, which we call the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>way,</hi> as we have often proved before, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſaith to the contrary.</p>
               <p>In the ninth place he brings in two or three Scriptures together out of Doctor <hi>Draytons</hi> ſermon upon one and the ſame head, as he might have found more of the ſame kind there: They are theſe; [that the Apoſtle prayes for the perfecting of the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. and ſurely they prayed for things feaſible and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable; nor can the prayer of Chriſt for the ſame be in vain, <hi>John</hi> 17.25. <hi>I in them, and they in me, that they might be made perfect in one.</hi> Unto which page 47 he gives in the old lying and ſinful diſtinction for an anſwer; namely, That the Apoſtles prayed for the perfecting of the Saints, and ſo did our bleſſed Saviour, and they obtained what they prayed for, that is to ſay, to have them ſincere in this life, and to have grace conſummate in the ſtate of glory.] But we have proved that the ſincerity which <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Saints was a ſtate devoid of ſin, and to be had before, and in order unto the kingdome of glory; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>That ye may approve the things that are excellent, and that ye may be ſincere, and without offence till the day of Chriſt, and that ye may be filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23. <hi>Now the very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly, and I pray God that your whole ſpirit, ſoul and body, be reſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But he brings in two replies of ours, by way of Anticipation like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; the firſt of which is this, is ſin pardoned and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29469:56"/>and doth it yet remain. [Which he anſwers with his old <hi>crambe centies poſita,</hi> It is ſo pardoned as not to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; its ſo mortified that the power and dominion of it is taken away, yet it remaineth to be more and more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and wholly caſt out at the death of the body; and death ſhall be deſtroyed at the general reſurrection, and ſo it is the laſt enemie that ſhall be deſtroyed.] But though he and others have often and confidently affirmed that ſin ſhall be caſt out at the death of the body, they could never bring one Text of Scripture for this article of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, nor ſhould they be able to do it though they live to the age of <hi>Methuſhelah,</hi> whoſe name and life is a dart of death againſt ſin and their poſition. Then he brings in our ſecond reply, which, as he ſaith, is this; When muſt ſin be purged out if not in this life? muſt we carry the remainders of ſin into the kingdome of heaven, <hi>whereinto no unclean thing ſhall enter?</hi> Rev. 21.27. To which he gives us his old thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare and beggarly (we had almoſt ſaid) and lowſie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that men ſhall not carry the remainder of ſin into Gods kingdome with them, but they ſhall lay it down at the death of the body.] Then there is hope that none ſhall go to hell for corruption, or thereby be debarred from heaven; there is hope alſo that the Vindicator may then lay down his lying and his other lewd prrctiſes againſt God and man at that day. [The thief (ſaith he) onely converted ſhall be that day in paradiſe.] Therefore he may ſafely continue in his ſin till the hour of death.] But what if that thief had repented long before, even from his firſt apprehenſion, or perhaps from the committing of the fact? for this is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Scripture hath nothing to the contrary. Yea, what if he belived on Chriſt afore, having heard of or ſeen his miracles, though he had not the opportunity to confeſs him till now, nor to pray unto him face to face: nor doth he underſtand what paradiſe this was into which Chriſt and he entred; for the firſt paradiſe is a ſubmiſſion unto Gods will even under the puniſhing hand of God; and the laſt is the <hi>third heaven</hi> unto which <hi>Paul</hi> was caught by way of viſion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4. [And as for <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. he ſaith
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29469:57"/>it is confeſſed by our own fraternity to be the ſtate of the Saints in <hi>patria.</hi>] Its true, all the reformed Churches, and that of <hi>England,</hi> (whoſe firſt reformation might have been a pattern to all the reſt,) doe almoſt generally conceive that the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or heavenly City of God ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 21, 22. chap. is the ſtate of the Saints in <hi>patria;</hi> and ſo do the Papiſts alſo for the greateſt part: which of thoſe then muſt be our fraternity? But there are ſome of both Religions that hold the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be an eſtate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this life; becauſe <hi>John ſaw it deſcending down from heaven unto men as a tabernacle of God wherein they were to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him; and he heard a loud voice following, and ſaying, behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he ſhall dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelfe ſhall be with them, and be their God, Rev.</hi> 21.1, 2, 3. But herein all doe agree that men muſt ceaſe to be of Mr. <hi>Tondrings</hi> fraternity before they can enter into this ſtate, <hi>for there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or maketh a lye,</hi> Rev. 21.27.</p>
               <p>Then he concludeth with the like confidence as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; [And thus have I briefly proved unto you the truth of the point (which yet hath not one point of truth in it) That ſin will have a being in the beſt of men while their ſouls have a being in theſe houſes of clay: And this I hope, ſaith he, may be ſufficient to ſatisfie the people.] Yea, and perhaps ſome of the Prieſts alſo, who are very eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſleep ſtill in ſin, and loth to be put upon an hard en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter againſt the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> for ſuch are apt to believe the unbelieving ſpies, and much more the Scout-maſter-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, who like his Maſter <hi>doth go to and fro compaſſing the earth, and walking up and down in it.</hi> [And if, ſaith he, I ſhall meet with any new arguments from my friends againſt the truth of the point I ſhall endeavour to anſwer them by way of replication for their full ſatisfaction.] We are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him for his promiſed endeavours, and ſhall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him when he hath ſet all the world on fire in the love of ſin, with this epitaph, <hi>Quae ſi non tenuit, magnis tamen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit auſis.</hi> [As for their old arguments, ſaith he, they ſtink
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29469:57"/>before God and good men, <hi>Romes</hi> good creatures excepted.] But our hope is that when the true Sabbath comes our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhall no more ſtink then the <hi>Mannaa</hi> which was kept from the ſixth to the Sabbathday, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.24.] But his and their doctrine who take his part therein ſhall be like the river in <hi>Egypt, turned into blood;</hi> for it is but the fading no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fleſh and blood, whoſe fiſh ſhall die, and the river it ſelf ſhall ſend forth a ſtink, where the light of Gods truth and wiſedom is and doth appear, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.18. Yet he proceeds and ſaith [that our arguments have been ſo fully anſwered and confuted (but we know not by whom) that were not men paſt ſhame (as himſelfe is in denying his own Mother, ſiſter, and wife, when they write unto him) ſet on work of hell (to wit, to ſtir up men to purge away all ſin by ſeeking and ſetting up thereagainſt the kingdom of Chriſt,) and ingaged for wages to <hi>Rome,</hi> (but doth the <hi>Pope</hi> then hire men to cry down ſin, and preach up Chriſts kingdome?) they would forbear to diſturb the peace of Gods Church.] But who are Gods Church? are they not ſuch as are <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2, 3. and what is the peace of his Church? is it not to have the enmity ſlain &amp; the partition-wall of ſin between us and God, &amp; between each other, broken down by Chriſt? <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. Doe we then diſturb or interrupt this peace by our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? yea we further it all that we can; it is he and thoſe which hold forth his doctrine who with the falſe Prophets make the breach between God and man wider, inſtead <hi>of hedging up the gap, Eze.</hi> 13.4, 5. if we diſturb the peace of any Church it muſt be that which cals her ſelfe Chriſts Church, but in this and the like doctrine differs not far from the Synagogue of Satan, as will be more evident here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But pag. 48. he tels us for a farewell to this point or poſition [That he and his party doubt not but maugre the malice of men and devils (whom he hath often in his mouth) truth ſhall hereby be made more manifeſt, and ſhall prevail, and that the folly of thoſe that reſiſt the truth ſhall be made manifeſt to all men.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29469:58"/>Lord in mercy ſtrengthen our faith in the belief of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. <hi>They ſhall proceed no further</hi>] Unto all which in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe we ſay Amen, knowing him to come as nigh to thoſe deceivers of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks as <hi>Joannes</hi> doth to <hi>Jannes.</hi> And then he paſſeth on to his ſecond poſition, which he hopes to clear as the former; and ſo he may quickly do, even as ſmoke cleareth the eye-ſight. The ſecond poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, [That no man can by grace in this life perform ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God as not to offend againſt the ſame; or to be thereby juſtified other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then in and by Chriſt of grace given. Which mixt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he reſolves into three branches, or ſingle poſitions, as we told you at the beginning: Firſt, that no man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God as not to offend againſt the ſame: which was our entire ſecond po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition agreed upon at the firſt. Secondly, that no man can be juſtified by the works of the Law, or by his obedience thereunto. And thirdly, that we are only juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. And for the better underſtanding of the point, ſaith he, which points, by his own diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are three, we muſt know that grace (he means the word Grace) is an equivocal word, and that it is taken two ways in the Scripture, (he might have ſaid ten ways at the leaſt) firſt, <hi>pro gratia gratis data,</hi> the free gift of God infuſed into our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt.] But ſo are not only the common gifts which the Schoolmen call <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> but the grace of ſanctification, which they call <hi>gratia gratum faciens:</hi> which of thoſe then doth he mean here? doubtleſſe that grace of regeneration, contrary to the ſenſe and diſtinction of the Schools. Then ſecondly, ſaith he, [grace is taken <hi>pro gratia gratum faciente,</hi> for the free favour of God whereby he makes us acceptable to himſelfe; and in this laſt ſenſe, ſaith he, we ſay that we are juſtified by grace, that is, by the free favour of God whereby he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth not our ſins, but he accounts us juſt by imputing Chriſts juſtice to us] By which you may take a view what a learned Schoolman he is for his age, who ſaith, that he is ſixty five years old, or ſomewhat ancienter than his own
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29469:58"/>Mother, if we miſtake not the year of her age. Now as grace is taken by him in the firſt ſenſe, for we ſay not that the Law can be perfectly fulfilled but by the grace of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, I ſay, ſaith he, that no man by grace in this life can perform ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God as not to offend againſt the ſame. Pag. 48. and 49. he ſaith [that God never gave (what not to Chriſt himſelfe?) nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will give ſuch grace to any, (what not in the world to come?) to fulfill the righteouſneſſe of the Law in their own perſons, and ſo thereby to be found juſtified or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by the ſame.] You ſee how far the Vindicator inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts himſelfe in the Counſell of God, as to know that he will never ſo juſtifie any man; and this knowledge he muſt have by private revelation, for it is contrary to Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will and practiſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. for, ſaith he, [it ſtands not with the glory of Chriſt that any ſuch grace ſhould be given from above (behold a bold peece of blaſphemy) and the reaſon, ſaith he, may be this, if by our infirmities the ſtrength of Chriſt be made perfect (as doubtleſſe it is in the renewing of mens ſouls, and the fulfilling of the Law thereby) it muſt needs follow that by our ſtrength the virtue of Chriſts croſs is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. Thus he.] But we ſay, he which hath learned his <hi>Chriſt-croſs</hi> may eaſily perceive that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not his <hi>A. B. C.</hi> in Divinity; for the ſtrength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Saints do or may fulfil the Law of God is not their own humane ſtrength, but the power and virtue of Chriſt, which derogates nothing from his croſs or ſufferings. But he backs his former ſaying with another Scripture which he underſtands as little, to wit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith that <hi>God hath made Chriſt to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him:</hi> where, ſaith he, the Apoſtle doth not ſay <hi>actively,</hi> that we ſhould make or work out our own righteouſneſſe, but <hi>paſſively,</hi> that we ſhould be made ſo <hi>ex indebita miſericordia,</hi> of Gods free mercy, the righteouſneſſe of God, and that not by our ſelves, but by another, Jeſus Chriſt bleſſed for evermore.] But what if he and all his adherents be herein
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29469:59"/>groſly miſtaken, and ſhamefully deluded by Satans impoſing a falſe gloſs and underſtanding upon them? if the main foundation upon which they build the hope of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſandy or rotten, what will become of the whole building erected and ſettled upon ſuch a <hi>baſis?</hi> Take notice then that the Apoſtles words which he here takes paſſively muſt be actively underſtood alſo, and that we muſt get our ſelves to be made the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt by deriving and putting on his righteouſneſs in the way of regeneration and renewing, and ſtrengthening grace to fulfill every commandement of God by his help and Spirit; to this effect the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks <hi>John</hi> 1.17. <hi>For the Law came by Moſes, but grace and truth</hi> (to fufill it) <hi>came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> John 15.5. <hi>I am the vine, and ye are the branches, he that abideth in me and I in him the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, but without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Rom. 5.17. <hi>How much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteouſneſs ſhall reign in life by one man Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>ſo by the obedience</hi> (Chriſts obedience in us) <hi>of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Rom. 8.3, 4. <hi>But what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us</hi> (not outwardly for us) <hi>who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit; for Chriſt is the end of the Law to every one that believeth.</hi> Rom. 10.4. Rom. 14.7, 8, 9. <hi>For none of us liveth unto himſelf, and no man dieth unto himſelf; for whether we live we live unto the Lord, or whether we die we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords: for to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe again and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace which was in me was not in vain, but I laboured more then they all, yet not I but the grace of God in me.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.31. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who is made unto us of God wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> (that is, in the underſtanding) <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> (in the will) not onely <hi>ſanctification,</hi> (in both) but <hi>redemption,</hi> (or glorification) alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>And that he therefore
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29469:59"/>died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> Gal. 3.24. <hi>For the Law was our ſchoolmaſter to bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified</hi> (or made righteous) <hi>by faith.</hi> But of this more anon, in anſwer to the Vindicators next words: [And thus, ſaith the Vindicator, doth the Apoſtle ſpeak, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That he might be found in Chriſt.</hi>] But let us call in that whole Text to give in evidence for us againſt him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Paul</hi> tels, <hi>that concerning zeal he was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> as the Vindicator is, <hi>unto perſecution, perſecuting the Church, touching the righteouſneſs of the Law</hi> (taught and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Jews, not onely in obſervance of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and the ceremonial Law onely, but of the moral Law, ſo far as an unregenerate man could compaſs the ſame by his own ſtrength) <hi>he was blameleſs:</hi> then in the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth verſes he tels us upon what ſcore he gave over that righteouſneſs, and all his native priviledges as he was an outward Hebrew or Jew; <hi>But what things were gain to me thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt; yea doubtleſs I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt,</hi> the righteouſneſs which is of (or from) God by faith. Thirdly, at the tenth and eleventh verſes by way of <hi>exegeſis</hi> he declares what that righteouſneſs of Chriſt is which he ſo much longeth for, namely, firſt, the righteouſnes of grace, <hi>that I may know him and the power of his reuſurrection</hi> (but wherein or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?) <hi>and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings</hi> (to ſuffer out all temptations, or to die unto ſin in a ſuffering way is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of overcoming all ſin, which becauſe the world knows not they deny the poſſibility of the work) <hi>being made conformable to his death, verſ.</hi> 10. and then the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of glory in the 11 verſe, <hi>if by any means I might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> both partly here in this life in the ſimilitude of Chriſts reſurrection, wherein Chriſt riſeth in them in great power and glory, and hereafter in a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29469:60"/>more tranſcendent eſtate when they obtain a glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which the Apoſtle looked for <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. Therefore the Vindicators concluſion hence is a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> to wit, that no man can by grace in this life perform ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God as not to offend againſt the ſame. But in page 49 and page 50 he comes with great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of words, and little truth, to ſhew how the Law may be ſaid to be poſſible or impoſſible unto us; and as to the firſt he ſaith [it is poſſible in a two-fold ſenſe; firſt, in regard of outward order and diſcipline.] But this is rather one uſe and effect of the Law to ſet up and keep ſuch order, then properly its poſſibility. Secondly he ſaith [it is ſo by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs, by the benefits of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and regeneration; which benefits, he ſaith, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by faith.] But we have ſhewed already that juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification are not two, but one benefit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that is of grace, is freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and given to the believer that ſeeks it aright: [For ſuch, ſaith he, God looks upon in the face of his Son (to wit, if the Son be preſent there with his righteouſneſs) <hi>in whom alone he is well pleaſed, Matth.</hi> 3.17. And his fulfilling of the Law is their fulfilling of it (to wit, if it came to paſs within them, but not without them, as he meaneth) though not in the ſame manner, yet to the ſame and as good effect as it had been done by themſelves alone; which, ſaith he, is thus done: He for them (yea and both with them and in them; they by him, (to wit in a coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative way onely;) he actually performed (ſo did they alſo) and they by imputation; (yes, if you take that for his free gift and contribution of his help) he by vertue and merit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, they by gift &amp; grace.] Thus all his words are in ſome ſort true, but not in his ſenſe. And thirdly, ſaith he [as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beginning of inward and outward obedience in this life, <hi>for this is the love of God that we keep his commandements,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3.] But here he is twice miſtaken; for firſt, that obedience is the ſame thing which we ſpeak of, and he ſhould have done if he had underſtood himſelf in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going member: and ſecondly, that Text of St. <hi>John</hi> doth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29469:60"/>not in that Scripture ſpeak of an inchoative obedience only, but of a complete obſervance of the Law, the which he and his fellow-Apoſtles, with divers other other brethren, had already attained. [But the Law is impoſſible (ſaith he) to the regenerate in reſpect of God, that is, ſaith he, as he is the perfect outward and inward obedience of the Law.] Which is falſe: but how proves he it? Page 50. he firſt cites that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. which we have had ſo often before: <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant O Lord:</hi> and there he alledgeth ſome of his former reaſons; Firſt, they fulfill not perfectly, becauſe they do many things againſt the Law.] But are the Saints neceſſitated to do ſo unto the end of their lives? <hi>for in many things we offend all,</hi> ſaith <hi>James,</hi> c. 3.2. and I am ſure he hath oftener then once offended, in wreſting this Scripture againſt the Apoſtles and perfect Saints, which <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks to the younger believers. Then he adds out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>[who knoweth the errours of his life?]</hi> Surely not till God revealeth them, which he doth to his ſervants who deſire to be humbled for them, and healed of them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal it unto you.</hi> Iſ. 30.21. <hi>And thine ear ſhall hear a voice behind thee, ſaying, this is the way, walk in it, when ye turn to the right hand, or to the left.</hi> [Secondly, thoſe things which the regenerate do according to the Law are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (what in their youth and old age in Chriſt alſo?) for there are in the regenerate, ſaith he, as I have ſhewed in my former poſition (but with much ignorance and errour) many ſins remaining, as original ſin, ignorances and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities (he meaſures all men by his own laſt) which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and bewaile, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 64.41.] But that is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets confeſſion in the behalfe of the unregenerate; <hi>We have been as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſs is as filthy raggs:</hi> which words (we fear) the Vindicator may uſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his preſent eſtate, for all his pretenſe to the work of regeneration; for his life and doctrine bear witneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Then he comes to a ſecond diſtinction or theſis, [the perfect obedience to Gods Law is fulfilled in us two wayes; firſt, by application of Chriſts righteouſneſs unto us (to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29469:61"/>wit, like one of his outward emplaſters;) he is our head, ſaith he, (what of the evill doers?) and we his members (what when we give our members as weapons of unrighteouſneſs to ſin and corruption?) and are ſo rivited with him that we are not to be taken aſunder, but as one body with him.] Which is true only of thoſe <hi>which are firſt implanted into him by the ſimilitude of his death, and after by the likeneſſe of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> as we ſaid before: but the Vindicator and his party hold neither of thoſe eſtates attainable in this life. [By vertue of which communion, ſaith he, it comes to paſſe that that which is ours is his, (yes, when we yield the whole deſire and delight of our hearts over to him and his ſervice in all righteouſneſſe) and that which is his, is ours; (then we can neither want underſtanding to know, nor power to keep his Law, for he hath both; ſo that in our head (that is, in our conceit and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination) we have fulfilled the Law, and ſatisfied Gods juſtice for our ſins, ſaith he, as I have ſhewed before.] But to ſatisfie Gods juſtice for our ſins, is one thing, which Chriſt alone hath done for them that leave their ſins; and to fulfil Gods Law is another, which we alſo muſt do by and through Chriſt working in us and with us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all theſe are meer dreams, and deluſions of Satan to make men ſecure, if not preſumptions, under the reliques, if not the whol body, of ſin. [Secondly, it wil be fulfilled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us (whether we ſleep or wake, as he ſuppoſeth) by and in our perfect ſanctification, to wit, in another world, though now our obedience is but in part: The Lord Jeſus (ſaith he) at the laſt day when the laſt enemy, which is death, ſhall be deſtroyed, ſhall bring it in us unto perfection] But what ſhall thoſe that dye before want their conſummation in grace and obedience till the generall reſurrection? and how is death the laſt enemy, when our ſins by perfect ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhall not be-deſtroyed and purged out till after death? How doth this man contradict himſelfe, who ſaid that in our perſonal death ſin ſhal be perfectly purged away, and grace conſummate unto glory?

[But how is that done? ſaith the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that is, ſaith he, Chriſt taking upon him our nature, and therewith the burthen of our ſins, hath condemned ſin in his bleſſed body, and ſo diſanulled it that it hath no power to condemn.] This is falſe as he underſtands it, for ſin hath a condemning power ſo long as it remaines unmortified in us, as the Apoſtle witneſſes <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. and 7.24. and <hi>chap.</hi> 8.13. as we proved before: Chriſt hath purchaſed the pardon of ſin by his death, and hath it in his own hand to diſpoſe of, but beſtows it upon none ſave ſo farre as ſin is bewailed and left. There is then another body of Chriſt which muſt take away the condemning power of ſin, and that is the body and fleſh of his like ſufferance and grace; and that in order to that purchaſed pardon of which the bread bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſupper of the Lord is a type as well as of the fleſh of Chriſts word, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.16. [And this benefit, ſaith the Vindicator, doth the Apoſtle amplifie, ſhewing that by no other means we could obtain it.] Yet we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29469:63"/>you but even now another means which muſt go before the pardon of ſin: [for as, ſaith he, there is but one way without Chriſt for men to come to life, namely the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Law (which way is ſtill retained alſo in Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. he lets us ſee, ſaith the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, that it was impoſſible for the Law, (to wit now that we are fallen) to ſave us; and this impoſſibility proceeds not from any impotency in the Law, but from our ſelves, as the Vindicator truly ſets it forth, and that in a three-fold reſpect: for firſt, it craves of us that which we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, even an abſolute obedience unto all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and that under pain of death.] But whereas the Vindicator ſaith page 53. [that that obedience may moſt juſtly now be required of us, becauſe that by creation (he means in our firſt parents) we received an holy nature, and ability from God to keep this Law.] This is a falſe ground, as we have proved before: yet here in words he expreſly contradicts his former doctrine, ſaying, [that by reaſon of the depravation of our nature drawn on by our ſelves (which is as much as we affirm in that kind) it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that we of our ſelves can keep or perform the Law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the Law could not give us that whereof we ſtood in need, to wit, a full diſcharge for our infinite debt of guilt contracted by tranſgreſſion; for ſaith he, it promiſeth no pardon, but binds us faſt to the curſe: and ſecondly, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural grace to reform deformed nature: and thirdly, ſaith he, (but this laſt coincident with the former) though it ſhews us the way of life, yet it miniſters no grace to walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; nor doth his Goſpel miniſter ſufficient grace for that purpoſe. But to make us ſome amends he comforts us with lies, ſaying, [but all that which the Law, could not do, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by whom cometh grace and life, hath done unto us.] But hath Chriſt already performed for us and in us perfect obedience to the Law, and to that end fully reformed and renewed our deformed natures? [Theſe two, ſaith he, cannot be done till we be perfected in glory.] Then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes for his ſecond poſition, or the firſt part of it rather, but out of his falſe premiſes, [therefore there is no life to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29469:63"/>be found in the obſervance of the Law.] Unto which we have often replied upon undeniable grounds, that there is no life to be found but in the obſervation or Gods Law through Chriſt Jeſus. Again, he reſs us [that the Apoſtle in another place cals the Law <hi>the miniſtry of death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> becauſe it inſtantly binds men under death for every tranſgreſſion of her commandements.] It is true, the work of the Law by the help of the word doth give ſuch a condemnatory ſentence: but elſewhere the Law is called <hi>the perfect Law of liberty,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> 1.25. yea and <hi>our life</hi> alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46, 47. <hi>ye ſhall command your children to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

[Yet, ſaith he, ſo univerſall is this error of ſeeking life and ſalvation by their own deeds, that it hath over-run the whole poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Adam,</hi> nature teaching all men who are not illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by Chriſt to ſtand to the covenant of works.] But thoſe who are rightly illuminated by Chriſt, Grace teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſeek ſalvation in the works and obſervation of the Law, yet not out of their own ſtrength and endeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but by the grace and help of Chriſt;] which grace <hi>John Tendrings</hi> vindication curtaileth. [But the ſupernatural doctrine, ſaith he, of the Evangeliſt, page 53. teacheth us to tranſcend nature, to goe out of our ſelves, and to ſeek ſalvation in the Lord Jeſus:] All this is true if rightly underſtood; but ſo is not that which follows; and ſo to uſe the Law not that we ſeek life by fulfilling it (which here is impoſſible) but <hi>as a Schoolmaſter to lead us unto Chriſt,</hi> in whom we have remiſſion of our ſins (ſo that which is to be had in the laſt place he puts it in the firſt) ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our nature, acceptance of our imperfect obedience (what always, when it ſhould for times and means afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be made perfect?) benefits which the Law could never afford us. Thus, ſaith he, ye ſee it is impoſſible in our own perſons (but what if Chriſt be brought in hither to purge us and renew us fully?) to fulfill the Law of God, no ſuch grace, ſaith he, being given from above.] Oh the bold blaſphemy of man againſt the renor of the old and new Teſtament! <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.18, 19. and 30.6. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.32, 33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. and 10.4. [Or if we could (ſaith he) yet it is not poſſible for the Law to ſave us: [but he confeſſeth that it is not through any defect or imperfection in the Law, <hi>for the Law is juſt, and holy, and good, Rom.</hi> 7.12. but in regard of the corruption of nature, which Chriſt came
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29469:64"/>purpoſely to aboliſh, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 3.8. yea I ſay, quoth he, that although the Law be good, yet it is not good to that end, neither is it ordained of God for that end. (Yes at firſt it was, and ſtill is in force) yet he confeſſeth that the Law was given for a double end; firſt in common to all men, namely to diſcover ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10. and the wrath of God due to us for ſin, and to reſtrain all men by its rule and diſcipline from ſin, and to retain them in a civil courſe of morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the good of humane ſociety. And ſecondly, in ſpeciall; firſt, to the reprobate, to make them without excuſe, becauſe it teacheth them what ſhall be done, or left undone.] But all have not the outward Law, it is therefore the inward Law that doth this, and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is grace alſo afforded likewiſe to help us in the doing of the good required, and the reſiſting of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil forbidden. Secondly he ſaith page 54. [in reſpect of the elect, to incite us by the ſight of our ſins to ſeek out a Saviour; as he that informs us of ſome dangerous diſeaſe doth tacitly adviſe us to ſeek out ſome expert phyſician, (which is not <hi>John Tendring;</hi>) but the Law was never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it ſhould juſtifie us, or of it ſelfe bring us to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.] Yes, it was ſo at the firſt. But he brings divers arguments to prove that which we deny not (as he is very profuſe and prodigal in his proof of ſuch things;) For he firſt ſaith [that eternal life had been promiſed to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Law: then the promiſe had been vain.] So it had without grace in Chriſt. Secondly, if righteouſneſſe were by the Law then Chriſt had dyed in vain, becauſe it were ſuperfluous for him to dye for us, if we could attain it by the works of the Law; and therefore it is apparent that by the works of the Law no fleſh living can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Thirdly, for hypocriticall Goſpellers, ſuch as ſeem Saints in oſtentation, that they may play the divell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpicion (as <hi>John Tendring</hi> did till he went away) who ſay they have faith, but ſhew forth no works which are not vailed with hypocriſie, and which are not done or intended to wrong ends; for ſuch, ſaith he, let <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tell you how acceptable their works be to God, and whether
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29469:65"/>they be like to juſtifie them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.16, 17. For the Lord complaineth that <hi>he is weary of them, and that his ſoul hateth them,</hi> and bids them, <hi>bring no more ſuch ſacrifices to him.</hi>] But we demand of him whether thoſe men were Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, or pretended Profeſſors? whether the works which the Lord there forbids were Ceremonial or Morals: For, he forbids not the works of the Moral Law. Fourthly, he ſaith, [that for true Chriſtians <hi>that are born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh,</hi> but of God, if any works could juſtifie, it muſt needs be their works which are wrought in and through them by the ſpirit of God; and yet we ſay (quoth he) that the beſt works of the beſt regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men cannot juſtifie them before God: And thus we prove it; (how doth he that?) Firſt, becauſe all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that we receive in this life are given to us but in part, page 55. (ſure they are wholly and freely given,) as we ſhewed in the proof of the other poſitions, and ſo they are imperfect grace.] But ſee how he contradicts himſelf, and lyes againſt the Holy Ghoſt in his next words, which are theſe, [not that the Spirit of Gods works imperfectly, but that he means not to inrich us with any grace here while we are converſant with ſinful men in this vale of miſery, but only ſo far forth as he ſeeth it fit to bring us unto the kingdome of perfection, <hi>where that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.] But what if <hi>Paul</hi> looked for that here, ſaying, <hi>when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part</hi> (or but a piece-work) <hi>ſhall be aboliſhed and ſwallowed up,</hi> verſe 11. yea, what if <hi>Paul</hi> all that time enjoyed that which is ſo perfect? for he ſaith verſe the 11. <hi>When I was a child I ſpake as a child, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man I put away childiſh things.</hi> And if ſo, then the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicators concluſion will ſtand againſt us like the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> which fell flat to the ground, which follows in theſe words; And therefore our inherent juſtice being but as our knowledg is, imperfect, and therefore it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it ſhould perfectly juſtifie us before God.] But we have overthrown that ſuppoſition of his before.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29469:65"/>Secondly he ſaith [that though our good works are perfect in reſpect of the Spirit of God which effecteth them, yet they are tainted when they paſs through us, who are ſo ſubject to ſin as waters running through a dirty channel; and therefore cannot juſtifie us before God, in whoſe preſence every polluted thing ſtands condemned: whence the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 64.6. <hi>All our righteouſneſs is as a menſtruous cloth.</hi>] But neither are all Saints ſubject to ſin all their life long, nor can that which proceeds from Gods Spirit be tainted by us, nor is that the righteouſneſs of Saints, but of ſinners and unregenerate men which is ſo menſtruous, as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Howbeit he brings in <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Moral. lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. and <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>All mans righteouſneſs ſhould be unrighteouſneſs if God ſhould ſtrictly judge it:</hi> and then <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Wo to the moſt laudable and beſt life of men.</hi>] Unto which we firſt oppoſe theſe ſayings of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.29. <hi>If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doth righteouſneſs is born of him.</hi> chap. 3.7. <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you, he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous even as he is righteous.</hi> chap. 4.17. <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and then thoſe of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and 119.1, 2. and 128.1, 2. unto which we could adde many more. Howbeit he goeth on in the ſame lying ſtrain, ſaying, [if God laying aſide his mercy ſhould diſcuſſe our lives, or righteouſneſs, in the ſtrictneſs of his juſtice, it would be ſo, for God is a God of purer eyes, <hi>who charged his angels with folly.</hi>] Indeed <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> one of <hi>Jobs</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends, and of <hi>John Tendring</hi>'s gain-ſaying ſpirit, ſaith ſo, but falſly, <hi>Job</hi> 4.17, 18. for the Lord never charged any but the fallen Angels with folly ſo. But he tels us further, if you will believe him, [that the beſt of men when he lives on earth is both a Saint and ſinner; a Saint by reaſon of grace wrought in him, and a ſinner by his own natural corruption, which in ſome meaſure tainteth every grace of God; and therefore the beſt of theſe who being compared with their fellows might ſeem juſt indeed, yet looking to the ſtrictneſs of Gods juſtice they diſclaimed all their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29469:66"/>own righteouſneſs.] What that of grace and regeneration alſo? But who are thoſe Saints? St. <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> a lying and contentious zelot, with whom God is highly diſpleaſed, <hi>Job</hi> 42.7. But he brings in <hi>Job</hi> himſelf ſaying [<hi>chap.</hi> 9.2, 3. <hi>But how ſhould man be juſt with God? if he will contend with him he cannot anſwer him to one of a thouſand:</hi> and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 130. and 143. 2. of which we ſaid before that all this is true of man in his corrupt eſtate, and for a time afterwards, but not of the Saints beſt eſtate and growth upon earth. For whereas he ſaith page 56. that [<hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>that he knew nothing by himſelf:</hi>] it is true. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>that he was not thereby juſtified,</hi> he renders a falſe reaſon of that ſaying of the Apoſtle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf alſo, ſaying [though he ſerved God moſt faithfully in the inner man, yet <hi>he ſaw another law in his members warring againſt the law of his mind;</hi> and hence he cried out, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi>] What did he feel? ſurely a law of ſin; and felt ſuch a body of death continually, and yet knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by himſelf? Good Hyperbolick bring your ends nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer together, as the ſervant ſaid to his lying mother. Thirdly, ſaith he, [that although it were granted that ſome works of the Saints were perfectly good, yet any one ſin blotteth out the remembrance of our former righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24.] But that Text ſpeaks of a final Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie from righteouſneſs, not of one actual ſlip, or fall, as all men confeſs; otherwiſe <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and all the Saints of God during their time of actual fals had loſt all their righteouſneſs which they had wrought before by every ſuch by-ſtep or ſlip. Unto which he adds two ſayings of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> which he underſtands as little as the former: The firſt is <hi>chap.</hi> 2.10. <hi>[For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet ſhall offend in one point, is guilty of all.]</hi> That is, of violating the equity of the law, and contemning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the law-giver, which binds to the obedience of all the commands as well as to any one; yet is not this guilt to be underſtood of every breach of the law through ignorance or weakneſs, but of witting and preſumptuous
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29469:66"/>ſins. The other place, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.2. <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> of which we have ſpoken before; and therefore (ſaith he) are we taught every day to beg the forgiveneſs of our treſpaſſes.] Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we have ſaid likewiſe, that although we ſin not daily, we may daily pray ſo for our ſelves and others, to have our ſins pardoned, which have been many &amp; great. His fourth argument againſt juſtification by works (which in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſenſe we renounce) is that, [<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>We conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the works of the law:</hi> unto which he adds <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>That if ye ſeek to be ſaved (or juſtified) by the works of the law, then are ye debters to fulfill the whole law, and ſo Chriſt ſhould profit us nothing, who is given for that end.</hi> But he goes about to prove that here <hi>Paul</hi> excludes not onely ceremonial works, and works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace, but all works whatſoever: (how doth he that?) for, ſaith he, <hi>Paul</hi> writes not theſe things to unbelieving Jews, but to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who were believing Chriſtians.] But by his leave thoſe of the Jewiſh faith, who looked to be ſaved by their own works without the grace of Chriſt, were crept in among them, and had almoſt withdrawn them from the faith in Chriſt, as appears <hi>chap.</hi> 1.6. <hi>I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that ye are ſo ſoon turned from him that called you to the grace of God unto another Goſpel:</hi> See <hi>chap.</hi> 3.12. and 4.19, 20. and 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ſo this argument is falſe. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſaith, [that no work of man can be good before his perſon be juſtified before God; <hi>for without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> But a man may have faith to pleaſe God before a juſtifying faith; the firſt is in God the Father, the ſecond is in God the Son: ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>But without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, for he that comes to God muſt believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek him. Abel,</hi> (ſaith he,) was firſt accepted, and then his offering.] But that divinity of his agreeth not with Gods ſermon to <hi>Cain, if thou doſt well ſhalt thou not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted? and if thou doſt evill ſin lies at the door, Gen.</hi> 4.7. Nor with that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.16. <hi>A mans gift maketh room for him;</hi> which is true of gifts brought unto God as well as unto men, eſpecially if it proceed out of a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29469:67"/>good willing ſpirit. But page 57. he comes to anſwer ſome objections, which we preſent not, becauſe we oppoſe not his doctrine in this parergical diſcourſe. The firſt is that, to what purpoſe are good works, if we can neither be juſtified, nor merit by them? he anſwers [That as gold is good, yet not to aſſwage hunger, (yet his confiding friends gold and ſilver made him good cheer.) and the ſame hath admirable effects, yet not to make the blind man ſee; ſo good works have many uſes both neceſſary and profitable, yet not to juſtifie us before God, or to merit by them; <hi>for when we have done all we can, yea all that is commanded, we are unprofitable ſervants, Luk.</hi> 17.10. (to which Scripture we have ſpoken before.) But here he bringeth in ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt his own doctrine of the impoſſibility of keeping the law; as firſt, [If God gives us commandements which we cannot perform, it is in vain to exhort thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> to obey the ſame. Secondly, his promiſes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and means for keeping them, were but mockeries; as if I ſhould promiſe a child a thouſand pounds to carry away a Milſtone, which he is not able to wag. Thirdly, his puniſhments for the neglect and tranſgreſſion of them ſhould be unjuſt; for if laws be not made and proportioned to our power of performance, the law-giver may as well be termed a tyrant, as the laws themſelves unjuſt. But none of this can ſtand with the wiſedome and juſtice of God, <hi>viz.</hi> to command beyond our power or poſſibility.] Unto which objections he makes anſwer after his wonted manner with words of ignorance, errour &amp; falſhood: [firſt, ſaith he, God doth require of us to keep and fulfil his law, to teach us what we could have done in <hi>Adam,</hi> and what we owe to God.] But in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> or Protoplaſt we could do juſt nothing, for we had no being then, nor are we debters to God upon that ſcore, though perhaps upon another ſcore we are. Secondly, ſaith he there and page 58. [to ſhew us that it is our own fault that we cannot now keep the Law.] Which perhaps may be truly ſpoken, but not in his ſenſe and way [becauſe man abuſing his power and free liberty to do what he would, did loſe both, and now he muſt do
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29469:67"/>what he would not, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> received that ſtrength both for himſelfe and us.] He often ſaith it, but he never yet proved it. [Thirdly, God teacheth us, ſaith he, what we ſhould ask, and of whom; for God doth therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to do what we cannot perform, that ſeeing our own infirmities, and being wearied under the Law of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we might ſue unto the throne of grace for pardoning mercy, and the gracious aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us in ſome meaſure (ſaith he) (yea to the uttermoſt ſay we) to perform what he ſo juſtly requireth.] To which third reaſon of his we ſubſcribe, as alſo to that which he cites out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſaying, <hi>in the commandements we muſt know what we ought to have, and in our puniſhments we muſt learn that we our ſelves are the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uſes of our own wants:</hi> yea add hereunto, and of our own failings likewiſe: and in prayer we muſt learn from whence we muſt fetch the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of our defects, (or rather before we goe to prayer:) or, ſaith he again, to anſwer methodically (for all this while he hath been no very orderly man) God was upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to deliver a Law (what <hi>de novo?</hi>) that was never given before, but ſuch as was formerly ingraven on mans heart.] Thus far he ſpeaks truly; but what follows is not ſo true: [that the Law was now defaced &amp; obliterated through ſin;] for we have proved already that though the righteouſneſſe of the Law was obliterated, yet the knowledge of it was written in every mans heart with indelible characters: [it was not now for God, ſaith he, (no nor ever will be) to bend the rule of righteouſneſſe to the crookedneſſe of our affections, that ſo he might make it anſwerable to our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities (yes, through his promiſed and premiſed covenant of grace in Chriſt) but rather to ſet down a ſtraight rule, not in favour of our ſinful nature (which he hateth) but to expreſſe our whole duty, though it be impoſſible for us after we have loſt our ability to perform it] What is it ſo now impoſſible after that a new ſupply of grace and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is vouchſafed if we ſeek it? [For, ſaith he, he that hath lent a thouſand pounds may without injury demand it of them, and when he knoweth that thou haſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29469:68"/>ſpent it, and as a Bankrupt art not able to pay a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (which no merciful man will rigorouſly do, unleſſe it be to evidence his prodigality and folly;) ſo God having given us power to obey his precepts, may at any time juſtly call for the performance of the ſame, though he know that we by our ſins have diſabled our ſelves ſo much as to think a good thought.] But his thoughts herein are very evil; for we have proved before that God cannot in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and much leſſe in mercy, require of us that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for which we in our perſons never received, or could receive ſufficient power to perform the ſame: <hi>Ultra poſſe viri non vult Deus ulla requiri.</hi> Pag. 59. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds another objection of his adverſaries, to wit, that the regenerate have <hi>ſufficientia principia operationis,</hi> that is, ſufficient means and cauſes of well doing, his ſoul being enlightned, ſanctified, and aſſiſted by Gods ſpirit; and therefore he may perform what God requires. And then he goes about to anſwer it with mincing the truth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating Gods grace, ſaying [a regenerate man is enabled to doe good, but not perfectly, his undeſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill obſcured, his will diſtempered, and his power of doing good hindred by many luſtful temptations: and therefore theſe principles of operation being imperfect, our actions which proceed from thence muſt needs be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect likewiſe: which he proves with his old miſtaken Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, [<hi>Who can tell,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, how often he offendeth? cleanſe thou me from all my ſecret ſins:</hi> ye ſee (ſaith he) Saints have their ſecret ſins (and he himſelf wants not his open and manifeſt enormities;) I may, quoth he, have many ſins, and fail in many things which no man knows of (we doubt it not) nor yet my ſelfe, which yet are known to God; we cannot judge mens hearts: (Why then doth he judge ours for hypocriſie, and carying on new pretended lights in a dark lanthorn?) for we know not our own, it is Gods prerogative to <hi>ſearch and try mens reins, Jerem.</hi> 17.9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. and it is our duty with <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to pray, chap. 13.12. <hi>accept mine obedience, but pardon mine iniquity.</hi>] But the man of God doth not pray ſo there, as we have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29469:68"/>though he had his former ſins alſo. A choſen veſſel was compelled to ſay <hi>he knew nothing by himſelfe, yet was he not thereby juſtified;</hi> of which before. Thus ye ſee that his book is ſtuffed full of tautologies. [And this, ſaith [he, may ſuffice for the clearing of the firſt branch of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poſition.] Indeed it is pretty well cleared from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of truth or piety. But for further confirmation [he dares appeal to any mans conſcience (that is no more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then he is to keep it without offence to God and men) how upon the conſideration of Gods ſtrict judgement, and his own manifold infirmities, he dare juſtifie himſelfe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one act, not againſt God, but before God] But <hi>Abimeleck</hi> could do it, as himſelf confeſſed before: and <hi>Paul</hi> could do it for his habitual acts, as we ſhewed before, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not in fleſhly wiſedome,</hi> (and much leſſe fleſhly luſts) <hi>but by the grace of God we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> [And I doubt not, ſaith he, pag. 60. but the proudeſt heart would ſoon tremble, and the boldeſt face (ſave his own) would bluſh and be aſhamed, to have his beſt works, yea his prayer, ſcanned by the ſtrictneſſe of Gods Law and juſtice.] But <hi>Job</hi> could ſay chap. 6.17. <hi>My face is foul with weeping, and on my eye-lids is the ſhadow of death, not for any injuſtice in mine hands; alſo my prayer is pure.</hi> Hath not the Lord promiſed, <hi>Zephan.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may call upon the Lord, to fear him with one</hi> ſhoulder or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</hi> and <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.11. <hi>For from the riſing of the Sun unto the going down of the ſame my name ſhal be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered up unto me with a pure offering.</hi> But he goes on yet more confidently, ſaying,] And of the adverſaries to this truth I require <hi>(quâ demum authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate?)</hi> this one thing, that they will either produce a man, and prove it, that hath ever (what doth he mean from his youth up, without any corruption?) performed in his own perſon ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God as not to offend againſt the ſame.] Unto which we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that if ever we knew any ſuch we ſhould not be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29469:69"/>very forward to ſhew them to ſuch unbelieving and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits as he is of: and we have produced many ſuch already; as <hi>Caleb, Numb.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>John</hi> and his fellow-Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.7. with many thouſands more. [Or elſe, ſaith he, let them acknowledge their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with ſhame, and forbear oppoſing the truth (as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi>) and diſturbing the peace of Gods Church. [He might have ſaid the Devils chappel, if all the Miniſters of Gods Church were like himſelf: But as he is no living member of a true Church, which is a congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, ſo neither doth our doctrine diſturb, but further the peace of the true Church of God: <hi>Act.</hi> 9.32. <hi>Then had the Churches reſt throughout all Judea and Galatia, and were edified, and walking in the fear of God, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Holy Ghoſt, were multiplied.</hi> To ſuch <hi>Jorams,</hi> or high-flown ſpirits as he is, <hi>Iehu</hi> may anſwer, <hi>what peace, ſo long as the whoredomes of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> 2 Kings 9.21. <hi>for there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, Iſai.</hi> 5.21. [But he fears firſt by our malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedneſſe (in decrying ſin, and oppoſing Satans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to ſet up Chriſts) our ſin may become unpardonable: yet he ſaith that he ſhall pray for us, as he doth for himſelf (while he continueth in wickedneſſe) not that God would be pleaſed to convince us of our errours, and humble us in the ſenſe of our ſins and be merciful to our poor ſouls: (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we oppoſe his ſinful poſitions) But we pray that the Lord would vouchſafe him mercy in reality and truth ſo far as to turn him from his enterpriſe, and then we are ſure we ſhall be no longer accounted innovators by him, nor his oppoſite doctrine be eſteemed orthodox.</p>
               <p>But now at length he comes to the ſecond branch of his ſecond poſition, which, as he ſaith, hath theſe two parts to be conſidered [Firſt, that no man can be juſtified by the works of the Law. Secondly that we are only juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.] Both which are true, and ſuit well with what we ſpeak, if rightly underſtood. And concerning the firſt, he ſaith he hath cleared it before; (but he hath obſcured it rather by bringing the works of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29469:69"/>Spirit under the works of the law, as he will do it again by and by.) And here he tels us [that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons admirably and plainly to this point, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5, 6. ſaying, <hi>If ſalvation be of grace it is no more of works, for elſe grace were no more grace; and if it be of works it is no more of grace, for elſe works were no more works.</hi>] So that it is evident (ſay we) that the works that are here recited are not works of grace, but works before, without, and againſt grace: But ſalvation, ſaith he, is by grace, <hi>for by grace are we ſaved though faith, and that not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God; not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt. Epheſ.</hi> 2. And our Saviour tels us plainly, that <hi>when we have done our beſt we are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>] And ſuch a ſervant will he be for the Church, and his doctrine alſo unto which he pretends. [And reaſon it ſelf, ſaith he, drawn from the Scripture doth ſufficiently prove that we cannot be juſtified by our works; for if any works juſtifie us, (ſaith he) they muſt be done either before or after juſtification: but no works before our juſtification can juſtifie us, ſaith he, page 61. becauſe <hi>an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit;</hi> and theſe works not being done in faith muſt needs be ſin, <hi>for whatſoever is not of faith is ſin; and without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11.5, 6.] Thus he goes about to maintain that which is true in it ſelf with falſe grounds, as we have ſhewed before: [where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (quoth he) that <hi>all men before they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt</hi> (which as yet he is not) <hi>are ſervants of ſin, farre from righteouſneſs,</hi> and bring forth no other fruits but ſuch as deſerve ſhame and death.] Which is all as falſe as the other; for <hi>Cornelius</hi> was not as yet grafted into Chriſt when the Angel commanded him to ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet he brought forth many good fruits, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.1, 2. as we ſhewed before. Secondly, ſaith he [Reaſon it ſelf tels us that our works done after grace cannot be the cauſe of grace.] Yes, they may be ſome cauſe or means to procure a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent grace, for how can that which cometh after be the cauſe of that which went before? for the cauſe muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the effect: and ſo <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tels us, <hi>that good works do not go before him that is to be juſtified</hi> (which is not true in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29469:70"/>every behalf, (as we have ſhewed) <hi>but they do follow him that is already juſtified;</hi> and therefore they can be no more the cauſe of juſtification, then good fruits are the cauſe of the goodneſs of a tree: and that place of the Apoſtle (ſaith he) which I cited before proves it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> But there are good works which follow converting and ſanctifying grace, which yet may precede the great work of juſtification, and nevertheleſs are no works of the law, againſt which <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes in this controverſie. For firſt (ſaith he) <hi>Paul</hi> tels us verſe 9. <hi>that all, both Jews and Gentiles, are under ſin, becauſe all are tranſgreſſors of the law</hi> (true;) <hi>and therefore all the world muſt be guilty before God,</hi> and can no way be juſtified by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending innocency and righteouſneſs in keeping the law: (true likewiſe.) Secondly, he ſhews the reaſon why no fleſh can be juſtified by the law, [becauſe the law convinceth of ſin; for by the law cometh knowledge of ſin.] But what he addeth in the next place is partly falſe, and wholly impertinent: [but the law, ſaith he, convinceth them that are under grace (ſome of them it doth, who therefore had need to ſeek the juſtification which yet they want) of ſin, and who have the greateſt meaſure of grace (this is ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſpoken) to be ſinners, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.] But that Text ſpeaks of <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt converſion to Chriſt, not of his laſt and beſt eſtate. [Therefore, ſaith he, but by a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> they that do the works of the law by the help of grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified by the Law, (yes in one ſenſe they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the law is with them, and not againſt them) <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.23. becauſe the law ſheweth them likewiſe to be ſinners, (by which words he contradicts himſelf) as well, though not as great as thoſe are who endeavour to keep the law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of grace (with which he is better acquainted then with the other way of keeping it;) and therefore, ſaith he, the Apoſtle concludeth thus, <hi>that we are juſtified by the righteouſneſs of God without the law,</hi> as ye may (in his ſenſe) ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. from verſe 20. But whereas he adds his own ſubinference thereunto, ſaying, [therefore we are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by any righteouſneſs of the law, done either by the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29469:70"/>help of grace, or without the help of grace] that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apoſtles doctrine, nor true in it ſelf: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which he yields for his ſaid aſſertion is devoid of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaying, [for he that, obeyeth the law, howſoever he doth it, by the help of grace, or by his own ſtrength, yet he hath the ſame righteouſneſs.] Which we ſay is falſe, becauſe thoſe two differ as much as weakneſs and ſtrength, as fleſh and ſpirit, and as that which is natural from that which is ſpiritual, yea as heaven and earth from each other. Yet ſaith he fondly [the righteouſneſs of the Law, becauſe of the different manner of obtaining it, altereth not the thing: But the Apoſtle (ſaith he) ſheweth a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the righteouſneſs of the law and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith, (ſo he might as to matter, manner, and meaſure) <hi>for Moſes deſcribed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the righteouſneſs of the Law, that the man which doth thoſe things</hi> (however he doth them, by his own ſtrength, or ſome other help, if he doth them) <hi>ſhall live by them.</hi>] But this is a falſe gloſs of his upon <hi>Moſes;</hi> for ſo there ſhall be no difference between the righteouſneſs of the law required by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the deeds of the foregoing Teſtament, and the righteouſneſs of faith in the nevv Teſtament. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>But the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith ſpeaketh in this wiſe, If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhall believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhall be ſaved,</hi> verſ. 6, 9. [And therefore, ſaith he, becauſe the Apoſtle oppoſeth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law, and believing in Chriſt, and not the doing of the law by our own ſtrength, and the doing of it by the help of grace, it is apparent that we can never be juſtified by the works of the law, by what means ſoever we do them, whether by the ſtrength of nature, or by the law of grace.] But he neither underſtands this Scripture, wherein the Apoſtle is the obſcurer becauſe he is conciſe; nor fits or ſtates the oppoſition here aright: For, firſt, no man can be ſaved or juſtified by believing alone that God raiſed Chriſt from the dead, that is not the Apoſtles doctrine or meaning; but he that will be ſaved muſt believe that Chriſt likewiſe roſe again for our juſtification, that is, for to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29469:71"/>cleanſe us from ſin, and make us juſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Now it is not written, for his</hi> (Abraham's) <hi>ſake alone that it was imputed to him, but alſo us, to whom it ſhall be imputed if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him who raiſed Jeſus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification by faith to ſanctification:</hi> and the oppoſition is clearly made by the Apoſtle between the fulfilling of the Law by our own ſtrength, and between the doing of that work by the help of grace in Chriſt, or by faith in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. were it rightly underſtood; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. and <hi>chap.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. for as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14. concerning the knowledge of the law, that <hi>the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayeſt do it:</hi> ſo ſpeaketh <hi>Paul</hi> here concerning Chriſts ſpiritual word whereby we muſt be ſanctified to fulfill the Law, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8. <hi>But the righteouſneſs which is of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe; Say not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into heaven, that is, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But what ſaith it? the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart:</hi> it is the word of faith which we preach, to wit, an inward living word, Chriſt, to quicken us in all righteouſneſs, for the purging out of ſin, and the fulfilling of the law: and then it follows verſe 9.11. <hi>that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth</hi> (in way of earneſt prayer) <hi>the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God hath</hi> (for this end, even thy juſtification) <hi>raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> to wit, from all ſins, ſpiritual enemies, and the wrath to come. And this is the Apoſtles doctrine every where, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>chapters Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 10. ſo it is moſt evident out of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. where the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>that I may be found in Chriſt, not having mine own righteouſneſs which is of the law, but the righteouſneſs which is by the faith of Chriſt, even the righteouſneſs that is of God by faith;</hi> which he at the tenth verſe by way of explication ſets forth what that is, thus, <hi>that I may know him and the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> (and for the overcoming of ſin) <hi>the fellowſhip of his ſuffering</hi> (to ſuffer our every temptation with patience to

Thus both the Vindicators ſuppoſitions and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do fall to the ground or earth, and place from whence they came.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (ſaith he) in his firſt book <hi>de juſtificatione cap.</hi> 19. labours to prove by three ſpecial arguments, that all works of the law are not excluded from our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.] (Which thing he might juſtly do, ſay we, if he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the works of juſtification aright) [Firſt, becauſe faith is a work, and that there is a law of faith as well as of works; and therefore if all works were excluded from our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then faith it ſelf muſt be excluded, and ſo to be juſtified by faith were to be juſtified without faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the Apoſtles intent is <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. that neither the Jews by the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> his law, nor the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by their moral works, and ſo neither Jews nor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, could be juſtified by any works that they could do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they believed in Jeſus Chriſt. Thirdly, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhews <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. that the works which he excludes from juſtification are thoſe works to which wages are due by debt, and not by grace; and thoſe, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> are all ſuch works as are done by our own natural abilities without the aſſiſtance of any ſupernatural grace. Unto which he or ſome other anſwers page 63. thus; But unto all thoſe I ſay, we confeſs faith to be a work, and it is the commandement of God that we believe in Jeſus Chriſt; but we deny that faith juſtifies us as it a work is performed in obedience unto this command, but as it is an inſtrument embracing (yea ſeeking) Jeſus Chriſt aforeſaid; it is not the act of believing, but the thing holden (he ſhould have ſaid, firſt ſought and gotten, and poſſeſſed by believing) that is our righteouſneſs.] True, if he underſtood rightly what that is or ſhould be. Secondly he ſaith [that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is miſtaken in the whole ſcope of the Apoſtle, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not give us the leaſt intimation of what he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29469:72"/>meaneth, that we are not juſtified by any works done by our natural ſtrength: (The which is falſe, as we have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly proved as well as formerly;) but rather ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that inaſmuch as we are all ſinners againſt the Law, therefore by our obedience done to the Law, however done by grace, or without grace, no man can be juſtified in Gods ſight.] But this, as we ſhewed before, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to many expreſſe Scriptures; ſee <hi>Pſalm</hi> 15.1. and 112. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.13, 17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.5, 9. <hi>he is juſt, he ſhall ſurely live, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Mat. 12.37. <hi>For by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> Rom. 2.13. <hi>For not the hearers of the Law are juſt, but the doers of the Law are juſtified.</hi> See Jam. 1.22. 1 Joh. 3.7. <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you, he that doth righteouſneſſe is righteous as he is righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17, 18. as before. Thirdly he ſaith to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. cited by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> [the Apoſtle intendeth no ſuch diſtinction of works as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> alledgeth, but he excludeth all works, as well thoſe that are done by the help of grace, as thoſe that are done without grace, from the juſtification of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for thoſe works of <hi>Abraham</hi> are excluded wherein <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might glory before men, (true;) but theſe are the works, ſaith he, which he did by the helpe of grace.] Oh abſurd! for <hi>who made him to differ from other men? or what had he</hi> in that behalfe <hi>which he had not received? and why ſhould he or any other boaſt before men as if he had not received that grace?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.] for otherwiſe (ſaith the Vindicator or his friend for him,) if he <hi>(Abraham)</hi> were juſtified by the works done without the help of grace, he might as vvell glory before God as men; which is not true in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry behalfe, for he received his internal helps from God, and not from himſelf, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 100. <hi>It is he that made us, and not we our ſelves:</hi> But the Apoſtle tels us, ſaith he, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by thoſe works done by the help of grace he might glory before men (where doth he tell us ſo?) yet not before God, and therefore he vvas not juſtified by thoſe vvorks in the ſight of God] But as the premiſſes vvere falſe, ſo is the concluſion vvhich he dravvs from thence; for by
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29469:72"/>every grace of God he vvas juſtified in ſome kind of actual righteouſneſſe, and purged from the contrary ſin, vvhich is the only juſtification vvhich <hi>Paul</hi> pleads for in Jeſus Chriſt neceſſary to life. Nor is his next reaſon leſſe abſurd, vvhere he ſaith, [for if vve could be juſtified by any vvorks hovvſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever done, by grace, or vvithout grace, then the vvages, that is, eternal life is not counted of favour, but of debt] Is it not ſo when vvithout the rich grace of God the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required unto eternal life cannot be performed? [But (ſaith he) vvhen vve cannot be juſtified by our ovvn vvorks (nor are we ſo juſtified) but <hi>by believing in him that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ungodly</hi> (ſo that he makes them godly that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ungodly) who is in Jeſus Chriſt (what are any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly that are in Chriſt? ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.) that we are then juſtified by his righteouſneſſe, and ſaved by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; like the hungry dreamer, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.8. <hi>who dreameth that he eateth, but when he awaketh his ſoul is empty:</hi> Then faith, ſaith the Apoſtle, and not any kind of works is imputed to him for righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.] But here the new falſe Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Burſtou,</hi> corrupteth and falſifieth the Text, for theſe words (and not any kind of works) are not found there. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. what his reward is like to be; <hi>for if any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him all the plagues that are written in this book.</hi>] But Pag. 64. he ſaith, I ſhall here cloſe this point with theſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Firſt, that no man that is a ſinner can be juſtified by his own obedience to the moral Law. Secondly, that no man that hath offended the Law can be juſtified by his own ſatisfaction for his tranſgreſſion] But who denies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe? or to what purpoſe is all this, unleſſe, as we ſaid before, to entertain his Reader with kickſhaws? But wanderers love extravagancies. As to the firſt of theſe, he ſaith, [that <hi>by the Law cometh the knowledge of ſin, Rom.</hi> 3.20. that is, the Law accounteth all ſuch to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and accounteth them as tranſgreſſors, and therefore they can never be pronounced guiltleſſe by that Law which proves them guilty: but every man is a tranſgreſſor of the Law (to wit before grace, and for ſome time after) <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:29469:73"/>3.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8, 11. and our conſciences teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it to our faces: Therefore can no man be juſtified by his own obedience to the Law.] But what is this to the obedience of Chriſt in the Saints? by which alone, as we have often ſaid, they may be juſtified freely, and ought ſo to be. Secondly, he ſaith [that a ſinner which hath once offended can never by any action or paſſion of his own make ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God for his tranſgreſſion] Yet can God freely remit thouſands and millions of ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions to the converting ſinner: [and the Law, ſaith he, being broken, there is no way to be juſtified by the Law, but by making a plenary ſatisfaction for the tranſgreſſion: which no ſinners ſatisfaction can do, becauſe a finite act can never be a ſufficient value to ſatisfie the offence that is done againſt an infinite goodneſſe; as alſo, becauſe all that we can do (yea much more) is required of us now that aſſiſting grace is tendered, as our duty to the Law (or Law-giver) and therefore it cannot be rendred as any payment for the breach of the Law: Therefore, ſaith he, to conclude this point, or truth, we are not under the Law for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our perſons as <hi>Adam</hi> was, nor for ſatisfaction of divine juſtice, as thoſe that periſh: but we are under it as a document of obedience (what perfect or imperfect?) and a rule of living] But not as we ought to do, by his doctrine.] Tis not, ſaith he, publiſhed from <hi>Sinai,</hi> but from <hi>Sion,</hi> (but to whom is it ſo?) as a Law of liberty (what to take our ſleep and ſwing in ſin?) and as a new Law, not as a Law of condemnation and bondage.] Yes, it is ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſtill to impenitent and unbelieving men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>knowing, this that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſſe and diſobedient.</hi> And yet he ſaith Pag. 65. [that the obedience is not removed (yes, by his doctrine a great part of it is) but the diſobedience thereof is both pardoned and cured.] But how? perfectly pardoned, but inchoatively cured by his doctrine; for, ſaith he, [the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance thereof is neceſſary as a fruit of faith, (but mark how enormouſly he ſpeaks in the next words) but not, (ſaith he) as a condition of life and righteouſneſſe, yet neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29469:73"/>
                  <hi>neceſſitate pracepti,</hi> as a thing commanded, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion whereof is the incurring of ſin; not <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> as a ſtrict undiſpenſible means of ſalvation, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion whereof (yes, if it be habitual or final) is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory obligation to death.] But we have proved before out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18, 19. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.22. that this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Chriſt as the way to life by the neceſſity of a medium, or means, as well as of a precept, eſpecially of thoſe that have both ſpace and means to attain unto it in Chriſt [And thus (ſaith he) of the former of the two laſt branches of the ſecond poſition, wherein I have clearly ſhewed (as one would ſhew a ſmall and remote object in a dark night) that as no man can be juſtified by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, nor the works of the beſt Chriſtians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie them (what not in Chriſt?) And now he comes to the laſt branch, that we are only juſtified by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt; (which being rightly underſtood we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo maintain) [We beleeve and maintain, ſaith he, as the Scripture teacheth us, (what is that?) That we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and abſolved from our ſins, and ſo juſtified in the ſight of God, by and for (he ſhould have ſaid through) the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt.] And ſo do we, but not in his way and ſenſe: And though we have ſaid hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that juſtification and remiſſion of ſins are two different things, yet we would be thus underſtood, that the pardon of ſins in his ſenſe, which is to take away the guilt or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation unto puniſhment, and leave the corruption behind; and juſtification, that is, to make us juſt, holy and good, or liberative juſtification whereby ſin is purged out, upon which the pardon and removing of the guilt follows through the mercy of God and the merits of Chriſts death: we ſay that theſe are diverſe and diſſentaneous things: But otherwiſe, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is in the new Teſtament frequently to be underſtood of the dimiſſion and purging out of ſin by the Spirit, ſo both in the old and new Teſtament, by prayer, remiſſion, and forgiveneſſe of ſins, both theſe are connectively and collectively to be underſtood; becauſe where the Lord is pleaſed to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:29469:74"/>purge out ſin; and heal men of it, he always pardons it, or takes away the guilt; and never takes away the guilt but where the corruption and fault are firſt put away. Hence it is that not to impute ſin, as we ſaid before, is, firſt, to purge it by ſanctification, and then to pardon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2, 3. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. and where ſin is ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and not imputed, there the righteouſneſs of grace for the renewing of the ſame is freely imputed or given to the believing and obedient ſoul. But this premiſed, we return now to conſider what he ſaith; who firſt brings that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>As by one offence</hi> (or of one the ſin) <hi>guilt or judgment came upon all men to condemnation,</hi> (to wit, all that offended or ſinned in that one perſonal <hi>Adam</hi> of theirs, as he ſaid before) <hi>ſo by one righteouſneſs,</hi> or the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of one, <hi>the free gift came upon all unto the juſtification of life,</hi> that is, of glory; for there is a two-fold juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the one of grace, or the foregoing righteouſneſs, and the other of glory, or the evelaſting righteouſneſs.] But wherein doth this Text ſpeak for him, or againſt us and our doctrine? The ſecond Scripture which he brings is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us</hi> (to wit, a ſacrifice for ſin, and a patern, and motive unto us, teaching us how we ſhould in him root it out) <hi>that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him;</hi> firſt in grace, and then in glory, as we ſaid before.] Where the Apoſtles words make farre more for us, and our ſenſe and doctrine, then they do for him; for there is not the leaſt mention made in all the Context, or any where elſe in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that Chriſts perſonal obedience unto the law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us and for us ſhould become or be made our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The third Text of Scripture produced by him is that, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it therefore known unto you men and brethren, that through this man</hi> (or <hi>Meſſiah</hi>) <hi>is publiſhed unto you</hi> dimiſſion or <hi>remiſſion of ſins, and in him he that believeth that he is</hi> (or may be) <hi>juſtified</hi> (that is purged) <hi>from all things from which ye could not be juſtified</hi> (or purged) <hi>by the law of Moſes.</hi>] Which Text makes ſo clearly for us, that by way of warning we will adde Pauls next words, <hi>Look to it,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:29469:74"/>or <hi>take heed leſt that come upon you which is ſpoken in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Behold ye deſpiſers and wonder, and vaniſh</hi> (or come to nothing) <hi>for behold I work a work</hi> (in the days of perfect ſanctification) <hi>a work to which ye will in no wiſe give credit, though one tell or ſhew it unto you, Acts</hi> 13.40, 41. The words are cited out of <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.5, 6. and imply alſo an heavy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or the enemies figured thereby, which are the Devils. His fourth Scripture by him quoted is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but now ye are ſanctified, but now ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>] And as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures made not at all for him, but much more for us; ſo this is clearly alſo againſt him, ſhewing that waſhing from the act and habit of former ſins, ſanctification by Gods Spirit, and juſtification in in the name of Chriſt, are one and the ſelf-ſame thing, as we further proved out of <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. and other clear places. But here he ſaith [that ſome may object and ſay, this righteouſneſs is Chriſts, and how can a man be juſtified by the juſtice of another? Unto the which he anſwers with ſome truth and ſome falſhood; that as ſin is ours by propagation (which we have often ſhewed to be falſe) ſo righteouſneſs is ours (if we attain unto it truly by Chriſt) by imputation.] But his righteouſneſs which he here intends is onely ſuch by putation and imagination. [And as <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaith he, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſin to our condemnation (which is one of his old <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s) ſo Chriſt brought life by his obedience to our juſtification: Thus <hi>if many be made ſinners by the diſobedience of one man</hi> (which if rightly underſtood is undoubtedly true) then how much more <hi>ſhall many be made righteous by the obedience of man, Jeſus Chriſt? Rom.</hi> 5.19. eſpecially ſince the nature of Chriſt, as he ſaith, page 66. is far more divine then the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore is more powerfull in ability to work this effect to juſtifie us, then <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was to condemn us. But as <hi>Adams</hi> ſin without us, and our conformity thereunto, condemns us not, ſo neither doth Chriſts obedience, which is <hi>ab extra,</hi> juſtifie us; we ſpeak of his active obedience: and by his paſſive we have another
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29469:75"/>benefit, the pardon of ſins upon our leaving of them: and 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12. ſaith he, <hi>this is the record that God hath given us, to wit, eternall life;</hi> to whom was it given? to <hi>John,</hi> and thoſe in whom Chriſt was riſen in the power of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, and this life is in his Son, ſo that <hi>he which hath the Son</hi> (in that manner) <hi>hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life as yet,</hi> that is, ſaith the Vindicator, he hath the righteouſneſs whereby he bringeth us to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.] But this is his gloſs upon the Text, and a meer dream and deluſion; and this, ſaith he, doth the Apoſtle moſt excellently ſhew unto us, when he ſaith, [<hi>that God made Chriſt to be ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. which we even now cited.] But he ſpeaks no ſuch thing as he aims at, or dreams of; for, ſaith he, as our ſins were made the ſins of Chriſt, not by altering or tranſplanting them inheſively into his own perſon, but by aſſumption of them imputatively to make ſatisfaction for them, as fully and truly as if they had been his own inherent ſins; even ſo the righteouſneſs of Chriſt (but not his externall obedience) is as truly made ours by imputation (his inherent righteouſneſs whereby he and we obey God is ſo) as if we had perfectly fulfilled the law by our own perſonal and actual operation.] Prove this by Scripture (Vindicator,) and you ſhall be made a Doctor in Divinity, which you never was, nor will be. [And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaith he) juſtification is a gracious and judiciall act whereby he judgeth (he ſhould have ſaid a judicious and moral, a phyſical or metaphyſical act of God whereby he judgeth) (firſt, maketh righteous, and then judgeth them ſo) the elect being in themſelves liable to the accuſation and condemnation of the law, to be juſt and righteous by faith in Jeſus Chriſt through the imputation of his own juſtice, to the praiſe of his power, and the eternal ſalvation of their ſouls.] Which deſcription of juſtification is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, and ſhews how farre he and thoſe from whom he borrowed it are out of the way, and how ignorant they are in fundamentals, even one of the main grounds of their ſalvation; which deſcription he notwithſtanding goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to explicate by the cauſes, as follows; ſaying, [Now
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29469:75"/>for the cauſes of juſtification, firſt, they are eſpecially the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; ſecondly, material; thirdly, the formal; fourthly, final.] Why would he have any more then four cauſes of an effect? I fear in this buſineſs he muſt content himſelf with fewer for the effecting and producing of the juſtification at which he aims. [But each of theſe aforeſaid, ſaith he, muſt be conſidered two wayes; firſt actively, in reſpect of him that juſtifies us: and ſecondly, paſſively, in reſpect of the man who is juſtified: firſt, the principal cauſe of our juſtification actively conſidered, is God freely purpoſing to ſend his Son to be made man, to work righteouſneſs for men.] But God juſtified men in the Old Teſtament by the Spirit of his Son, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.8. and 5.3, 11. where he cites 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Then, to wit, in the fulneſs of time, God ſending his Son made of a woman, made under the law;</hi> then revealing his Son unto us by the preaching of the Goſpel, and perſwading us to believe the ſame, and lay hold on the Son of God by the operation of the bleſſed Spirit, and then accounting unto us the obedience of his Son for our righteouſneſs.] In all which he is gone out of Gods road, or way of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and from the truth of the Goſpel; for though God ſo ſent his Son made of a woman, and made under the law, yet it was not to juſtifie us by active obedience unto the law, as we have ſaid: [And this he did, ſaith he, to ſhew that he is the beginning, the middle, and the end of our juſtification: and to prove this, the Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins:</hi> and the Apoſtle plainly ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.

[Again, the impulſive cauſe that moved God to do all this for man, we find (ſaith he) to be two-fold; firſt, internal; ſecondly, external: the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29469:76"/>firſt is the meer grace and free mercy of God towards men, and this becauſe he would be merciful to man: Becauſe we can aſcribe no other cauſe of Gods will, which is the cauſe of all things, to wit, in their firſt creation, but onely this, <hi>quia voluit,</hi> becauſe he would; But in acts of providence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the puniſhment of ſin, there may be an external cauſe found in the creature; And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he attributeth our redemption <hi>to the riches of his grace, Epheſ.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4, 5. where he ſaith, <hi>that after the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Whereby you ſee the Apoſtle maketh the kindneſs, love and mercy of God to be the efficient, principal cauſe or motive that moved God to ſend Chriſt to be the means of our ſalvation.] Nor is this denied at any hand; but if the Vindicator had taken in one verſe more of <hi>Titus</hi> 3. he might have eaſily ſeen that rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration before deſcribed, and juſtification, is all one work and thing; for it follows there, <hi>that being juſtified by his grace</hi> (in the work aforeſaid) <hi>we might be made heirs according so the hope of eternal life.</hi> But he goes on thus; [And <hi>Auguſtine Homil. de Nat. &amp; Gratia</hi> ſaith, <hi>that it is the ineffable grace of God that a man guilty of ſin</hi> (yea, and ſay we, polluted with ſin) <hi>ſhould be juſtified from fin:</hi> And eſpecially againſt the Pelagian hereſie, who magnified nature, to villifie and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nullifie grace, he ſaith, <hi>that the grace of God whereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and men of years are ſaved is not procured by deſerts, but tendred freely without merits:</hi> and ſo <hi>Anſelm</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>that becauſe all men are ſhut up under ſin, the ſalvation of men cometh not in or by the merits of men, but in the morcy of God.</hi> The ſecond impulſive cauſe is Chriſt (ſaith he) God and man, who purchaſed by his merits that we ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God.] Which thing hath been juſtly queſtioned; for God might out of his free mercy and grace juſtiſie us without any ſuch merits; and though the death of Chriſt wants not its ineſtimable price and merits, yet
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29469:76"/>we are not juſtified in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe thereby, (and much leſſe by his active obedience) but only by his Spirit. But he gives us a reaſon for what he had ſaid out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.5. <hi>[becauſe the chaſtiſement of our offences was laid upon him, and that by his ſtripes we might be healed.]</hi> But here we would aske the Vindicator and his friends theſe queſtions; firſt, whether <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of a chaſtiſement that was paſt, or yet to come; for certain it is that Chriſt was <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world Rev.</hi> 17.8. Secondly, if it was a preterit ſuffering, whether it was not Chriſts inward and voluntary death for us, and in us, when vve firſt became actual ſinners? according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For when we were yet without ſtrength</hi> (according to the time) <hi>Chriſt died for the ungodly:</hi> and Gal. 3.1. <hi>Oh fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth crucified in you? Jam.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Ye have condemned and killed the juſt one, and he doth not reſiſt you.</hi> See Rev. 1.7. <hi>and all kindreds of the earth ſhall wail becauſe of him; even ſo, Amen.</hi> And if ſo, what peace was that which was procured for us by that his ſuffering and death? was it not a time and ſpace of repentance? for otherwiſe we, as alſo our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had immediately been ſent to hell. Fourthly, what thoſe ſtripes of Chriſt are by which we are healed? are they his perſonal ſufferings alone, inward, or outward upon the croſs; or are they his like ſufferings when we ſuffer with him or for him, dying unto all ſin? See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. <hi>For if we be dead with him we believe that we ſhall live with him:</hi> and chap. 8.13. <hi>and if children then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt: if ſo be that we ſuffer with him that we may be alſo glorified with him.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. This condition of conformity to Chriſts ſufferings, whether inward, (of which the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator and his party ſay nothing) or outward upon the croſſe, is not once thought of, though there is no other way left us in Chriſt to obtain ſalvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24, 25.</p>
               <p>Pag. 68. he tels us (but falſly) that [the material cauſe of our juſtification actually conſidered is Jeſus Chriſt.]
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29469:77"/>No, it is the perſon to be juſtified. [and the benefits which we have by Chriſt, ſaith he, are two eſpecially; Firſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; Secondly, propitiation. [But thoſe two, ſay we, will prove but one in the end. [Firſt, for redemption, ſaith he, it is a word borrowed from the uſe of war (and why not from other civil and judicial acts?) and it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies freedom from captivity; And thus Chriſt is our deliverance, (but how?) Firſt from the wrath of God (ſee his method,) he ſets that in the firſt place which ſhould come laſt) becauſe, ſaith he, he is our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion] And is not that <hi>a propitiation through faith in his blood? Rom.</hi> 3.25. which blood, ſay we, is the promiſed ſpirit for, and ſignified by blood in the old Teſtament, and not the blood of his croſſe, as he and others dream: ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and 10.39. and 13.20, 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. and 12.11. [Secondly, ſaith he, we are freed from the tyranny and dominion of ſin, becauſe that <hi>obeying from the heart the form of doctrine unto which we are delivered,</hi> that is, the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>we are made free from ſin, and are become the ſervants of Chriſt,</hi> which is our righteouſneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18.] Is this obedience then our righteouſneſſe? ſure he means nothing leſſe, though he ſpeaks truer herein then he is aware of: But he will have Chriſts external obedience to be our righteouſneſſe, and none other,. [Thirdly, we are freed, ſaith he, from the puniſhment of our ſins; becauſe its againſt juſtice the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhould be inflicted when the ſin is pardoned; for, ſin being the cauſe of puniſhment, it muſt needs follow that <hi>ſublatâ cauſâ</hi> (which he elſewhere ſaith cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away in this life) the cauſe being defaced (or rather removed) the effect ſhould be abſolved.</p>
               <p>But againſt this he ſaith it may be objected, [That the ſins of the elect are pardoned, and yet they are afflicted continually, and, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73.13. <hi>they are chaſtiſed every morning;</hi> and therefore how can it be that he ſhould for give the guilt of their ſins, and yet, as the Prophet ſpeaks <hi>Pſalm</hi> 99.8. <hi>he ſhould puniſh their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> (But there are no ſins pardoned, ſay we, till they be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29469:77"/>wholly left.) Unto which ſaid objection he anſwers [That the miſeries of men before the pardon of ſin are the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of ſin; but the affliction of the Saints after the remiſſion of their ſin are not to be reputed penalties of Gods anger, but exerciſes of his ſervants, and arguments of his love; for, <hi>as many as I love I rebuke and chaſten,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. ſo alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. and that for a double end; Firſt, for our ſalvation, <hi>that we ſhould not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. Secondly and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, for our ſanctification, that we may be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his holineſſe.] But what difference is there between Gods holineſſe and our poſitive ſalvation? is not eternal life a participation in full of Gods holineſſe? <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17, 13. <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied when I ſhall awake with thy likeneſſe.</hi> But God puniſheth thoſe ſins with temporal plagues in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for their humiliation and amendment, and for a warning unto others, which he pardoneth as to the world to come, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13, 14. and before the pardon of ſin men are chaſtiſed in love to their ſouls, as well as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94.12. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.11, 12. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7. As for Propitiation, he tels us page 68, 69. [that it is a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to God through the blood (to wit, the blood of his Spirit) and it is, ſaith he, the accompliſhment of that which was ſignified by the Mercy-ſeat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.] But the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat, or Propitiatorie, did repreſent Chriſt in the Spirit; and in his ſecond, or ſpiritual coming in the power of his reſurrection, when the two tables of the Law are written upon our hearts, and the face and aſpect of God and the ſoul looks towards each other, like the two Cherubims, through Chriſt the everlaſting propitiation and Prieſt. And that which the Vindicator ſpeaks there confirms it: for firſt, as God gave his oracles unto the Prophets, (he ſhould have ſaid unto the Prieſts alſo) out of the Mercy-ſeat; ſo he did, yea doth, reveal his will unto us (his Prieſts and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) by Jeſus Chriſt, not without us only, but eſpecially within us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. Secondly, as God was ſaid to dwell between the Cherubims, which covered the Mercy-ſeat; <hi>ſo in Chriſt the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29469:78"/>bodily,</hi> or really, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.9. And thereby as God was made propitious and favourable unto his people to aſſiſt and bleſs them, by the blood which the High-Prieſt ſprinkled before the Mercy-ſeat; ſo, ſaith he, he is pacified and reconciled unto us, and procured to inrich us with ſpiritual bleſſings through the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.18.] Which is true of both bloods, that of his Spirit, and that of his croſs; yea of the blood of ſin alſo, which we muſt ſhed in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the death and bloodſhed of Chriſt: But this laſt parallel is not apt but forced. Again he ſaith [the grounds of thoſe benefits, or the meritorious cauſe thereof is the moſt abſolute and perfect obedience which our Saviour Chriſt performed unto his Father for our ſakes, and is to be conſidered, firſt <hi>actively,</hi> then <hi>paſſively:</hi> firſt the <hi>active</hi> obedience of Chriſt is a moſt perfect performance of Gods Law, even to the utmoſt tittle thereof; touching which we muſt conſider-firſt, that although Chriſt as man fulfilled the Law for himſelf, that in both natures he might be an holy High Prieſt to offer ſacrifice unto God; yet as mediator, as God and man, he became ſubject to the Law, and did fully and perfectly execute the ſame for us.] But how doth he prove that? for Chriſt, ſaith he, is not only our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by that ranſome which he paid for our ſins, but he is alſo <hi>the perfection of the Law unto ſalvation</hi> (moſt true, but not in his ſenſe) <hi>unto every one that believeth.</hi> And there he three things, ſaith he, that prove the neceſſity thereof to be performed for us: (what are they?) firſt, the juſtice of God that will not juſtifie the wicked (to wit, while they remain ſuch in deed and will, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15.) but ſuch as are juſt and righteous, either by a proper, or imputed righteouſneſſe; (yet he juſtifieth the ungodly that turn from their ungodlineſſe, and that both by a proper and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſſe (as we have ſhewed:) Secondly, by the office of a mediator that was to undergo for us (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do for us) whatſoever was required of us to be done] But may not this be done as well within us by Chriſts grace and cooperation for us? yea vvith much more piety and juſtice; every man being created to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29469:78"/>obedience tovvards God and his Lavv. [Thirdly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a recuperation or recovery of happineſs, vvhich could not be attained without perfect righteouſneſſe; becauſe the death of Chriſt (as he ſaith) freeth us from erernal death (to wit, when we are dead with him unto ſin) and the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt (that within us only) brings us to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or everlaſting life.] All which you muſt take upon his word and credit, for he knows not how to prove it. [And therefore we ſay, (quoth he) that Chriſt was born for us, not only <hi>auferre peccata,</hi> to take away the ſins of the world (to wit by ſanctification) by his voluntary ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the moſt bitter death of the croſs, (but that only takes away the guilt, and ſhews us how in order thereunto we ſhould ſacrifice, flay, and conſume all our ſins,) but <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre juſtitiam,</hi> to bring righteouſneſſe unto us (but how?) by his plenary obedience (within us, not without us) to the moſt holy Law of God.] Which is yet unproved [And therefore thoſe Scriptures (ſaith he) that do aſcribe our falvation unto Chriſts death (which none do) are not to be taken excluſively, or as denying the active obedience of Chriſt to be imputed unto us, but <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> for the accompliſhment of the whole obedience of Chriſt that was to be performed for us:] But none ſuch was to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for us, or upon our ſcore, as we have often affirmed; nor can the contrary be proved out of the holy Scriptures. [And with this affirmation of his (ſaith he) agree the main and major part, (for his tooth and dyet, as aforeſaid) of all orthodox (he ſhould have ſaid heterodox) Divines, and moſt of the Fathers] To wit, ſince <hi>Calvins</hi> days. [Secondly, ſaith he, the <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience of Chriſt is all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt both in life and death for our ſins.] (Yes, and much more alſo in our inward man for us, while we went on in our rebellion againſt God (of which he never thinks) becauſe the juſtice of God required that we ſhould never be freed from death without a juſt puniſhment (in Chriſt like death alſo) laid upon our ſelves, or on ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for us: (both which we grant.) And therefore, ſaith he, the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied that the <hi>Meſſiah ſhould be

And here we muſt obſerve (ſaith he) that this obedience of Chriſt is of ſufficient merit to ſatisfie for all ſins (and for thoſe that were repented of and left more eſpecially,) by reaſon of the dignity of the perſon that did obey (or ſuffer,) for the hypoſtatical union of the Manhood of Chriſt with the Godhead makes the obedience of Chriſt to be of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable value or price, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.18.] True; but that Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, the formall cauſe (ſaith he) of our juſtification <hi>actively</hi> conſidered is a free imputation of Chriſts actual righteouſneſſe (we ſay the inheſive) whereby the merit of Chriſts obedience is applied unto all beleevers, that is, the accounting of us juſt and righteous for the merits of that obedience which Chriſt effected for us, ſaith he, pag. 71.] But this is more formally then truly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; [for as we, ſaith he, apply unto our ſelves the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, and make the ſame our own by faith and acceptation (he ſhould have ſaid by meer imagination) ſo God himſelfe (ſaith he) applieth it unto us by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (according to his putation) and accepts us for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; (which we have not:) and this imputation of righteouſneſſe (ſaith he) is a work of grace [which God never ſpake or thought of] not of nature; a communicating of another righteouſneſſe; and not a conferring of any real (therein ſaith he truly) or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual righteouſneſs upon us.] But without ſuch a real or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual

[Becauſe, ſaith he, there is no mortal man living whoſe righteouſneſs, (to wit his own) can be ſufficient to obtain eternal ſalvation.] But if the Frier meant it as the Vindicator doth, we hope the Vindicator will turn Frier alſo. [But (ſaith the Vindicator) Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is made ours, not becauſe it is infuſed or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into us,] Oh take heed of that, for it would drive out ſin too ſoon, to abide habitually in us; [but becauſe it is imputed and reputed unto us] rather by him and his party, then God [as if it were theirs (when it is not) whom God doth acquit from ſin, and actually count juſt for the juſtice of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore the force of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (however I eaſily beleeve it) is not any habitual ſanctity ſubjectively remaining in us, but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt (of which in his ſenſe there is no mention in the Scriptures) freely imputed unto us, and ſo though it be without us, (and they without it) yet it is made ours by right of giving. (if he knew by whoſe gift.) The Apoſtle (ſaith he) remarkably in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. joyneth both the imputation of righteouſneſs and the remiſſion of ſins toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the two ſpecial means to make us happy;] And ſo do we, but not in his way, which will never make any happy. [<hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works,</hi> (to wit, his own works, before, and without grace.)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:29469:80"/>
                  <hi>And bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin,</hi> (but purge it away by his grace and Spirit.) [But this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt thus imputed to us, ſaith he page 72 muſt be conſidered in a three-fold reſpect: firſt in reſpect of the truth of our imputed righteouſneſs,] which is wholly a fancy:) and ſo we ſay, that we are as truly righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God as Chriſt himſelf. [Beware of blaſphemy whorſon Phanatick;] becauſe we are righteous with the ſame righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs with which he is righteous. (The clean contrary way.) Secondly, in reſpect of the quantity: But ſo we deny that it is in the ſame meaſure (he might truly have ſaid, in any meaſure) for in him it is in its fulneſs, and in its largeſt meaſure; but in us it is onely received ſo far forth as it ſerveth to juſtifie any particular believer (he ſhould have ſaid dreamer, that is not at all.) Thirdly, in reſpect of the quality: And ſo we ſay that this is not in the ſame manner in us as it is in him, (which is true enough) for he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actually, we imputatively (or paſſively rather;) he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively, we relatively in him, and by him,] that is, not at all but by meer relation, or tradition, and our fond credulity. [And ſo, ſaith he, in theſe two laſt reſpects we cannot be ſaid to be equally righteous with Chriſt (no nor with the leaſt real Chriſtian who ſeeks the true righteouſneſs by Chriſt) though we be righteous with the very righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, (to wit, as <hi>Laodicea</hi> was, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18.) he perfectly righteous, we righteous by reaſon of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and inchoative righteouſneſs.] Which laſt, if he have any, is the beſt ſtring for his bow, by reaſon the other is a broken one. [Again, ſaith he, Chriſt is called holy, and ſin, and yet is ſaid to know no ſin, and to be made ſin: ſo likewiſe are we ſaid to be juſt, and ſinful; juſt in him (or rather juſt out) by the imputation and application of his juſtice (without any converſion from ſin;) and ſinful in our ſelves by the inbred corruptions of our own fleſh, which is brought in by our perſonal fall, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the final cauſe of our juſtification actively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered is the glory of God, which he acquired unto himſelf
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29469:80"/>by the wonderful mixture of his juſtice and mercy towards men; juſtice, and mercy alſo, that he would have his own Son die to make ſatisfaction for our ſins (yea ſuffered to procure us ſome reſpite of repentance and returning, as ſaid before) rather then our ſins ſhould eſape unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or we forthwith periſh eternally, and mercy, that he would have the righteouſneſs of his Son be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted (no, derived) unto his ſervants, rather then we poor ſinners ſhould periſh for or in our ſins.] But if he have no better skill in compounding his own medicines then he hath made here in this jumble of juſtice and mercy, he is a Phyſician of no value. [And thus much, ſaith he page 73. of the cauſes of juſtification actively conſidered in reſpect of God: now in the ſecond place we muſt conſider the cauſes of our juſtification paſſively, in reſpect of man; and firſt, the efficient cauſe paſſively conſidered is wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental; and it is two-fold; external, which is the preaching of the word, and the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; theſe are the chief outward inſtruments which God uſeth for the application of Chrſts (ſuppoſed) righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for the (imagined) juſtification of his ſervants; and therefore the Goſpel is called <hi>the word of life, Acts</hi> 5.15, 16. and <hi>the miniſtry of reconciliation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. and the Sacraments are called <hi>the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith;</hi> and our Saviour ſaith of the preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>whoſe ſins ye remit</hi> (or put away) <hi>they are remitted.</hi>] But are the word and Sacraments paſſive or active inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? doth not the Apoſtle ſay that <hi>the Goſpel is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth? Rom.</hi> 1.16. Is the man infatuated?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the internal inſtrument whereby we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend (he ſhould ſay ſeek) the grace of juſtification is onely faith in Jeſus Chriſt.] But that is falſe; for by prayer alſo we both ſeek and comprehend the ſame: [But Chriſt is ſet forth, ſaith he, <hi>to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.15. <hi>John</hi> 1.12. (which place he wreſts from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe) <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. and therefore the righteouſneſs of Chriſt (but not in his ſenſe) is called <hi>the righteouſneſs of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29469:81"/>faith;</hi> and we are ſaid to receive Chriſt by faith, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promiſe of the Spirit (which is the purging blood of Chriſt) by faith. [Secondly, ſaith he, faith is the onely inſtrument] he ſhould have ſaid the main, yet no paſſive inſtrument, as he would have it [whereby we are juſtified before God. The Scriptures, ſaith he, are plain and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in this point; <hi>Iſ.</hi> 45.21, 25. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.44. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39.] But the firſt of theſe, if rightly looked into, cuts the throat of juſtification; for righteouſneſs and ſtrength are joyned together, which muſt intimate the inward and powerful righteouſneſs of God, and this it juſtifies the man; <hi>Iſ.</hi> 45.24, 25. where the words runne thus; <hi>Surely, ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength, even unto him ſhall men come; and all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be aſhamed; in the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified,</hi> (or made juſt,) <hi>and ſhall glory.</hi> Yea, that place in <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. ſhews, that he whoſe ſoul is lifted up (with any knowledge, or hope of a falſe righteouſneſs) is not upright in him; <hi>but the juſt</hi> (who is ſuch by any meaſure of inherent righteouſneſs) <hi>ſhall live</hi> (the full life of righteouſneſs) <hi>by faith.</hi> As for <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39, 40. we have ſpoken of that already. [And ſo, ſaith he, doth the Apoſtle in many other places inculcate the ſame truth, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5, 24. and our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15.] What doth he ſay there? (for the Vindicator cites no words) namely thus much; [<hi>that as Moſes lifted up the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the wilderneſs,</hi> that <hi>Iſrael</hi> reflecting upon their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine ſins and rebellion, might repent and not die; <hi>even ſo muſt the ſon of man</hi> (as crucified both in us, and for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>be lifted up</hi> (and ſet forth before us) <hi>that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth on him</hi> (as a pattern herein as well as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler, &amp; through faith follows him unto the like death) <hi>ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life,</hi> that is, ſaith he, (by his falſe gloſs,) be juſtified, and ſo be ſaved onely by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him.] A ſhort and eaſie way to be ſaved, if it were true; as thoſe Iſraelites that were bitten by the fiery ſerpents, <hi>Num.</hi> 21.9. were healed and ſaved alone by looking up to the brazen ſerpent. [The Fathers alſo, ſaith he, are

God hath juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us, uſing thereto no works of ours,</hi> (ſuch as we work of our ſelves) <hi>but onely requiring faith in Chriſt:</hi> (ſo ſay we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) and without faith no man obtaineth life: But I am able to ſhew, ſaith he, page 74. that a faithful man hath lived and obtained the kingdome of heaven without works.] Do it then, and give Saint <hi>James</hi> the lie, who ſaith <hi>chap.</hi> 2.14. <hi>What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man ſaith that he hath faith, and have no works, can that faith ſave him?</hi> [So the thief, ſaith he, did onely believe, and was juſtified.] But was not his reproving of his fellow-thief the condemnation of himſelf and his partner in thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and the accepting of his puniſhment, the juſtifying of Gods juſtice, and the clearing of Chriſt as innocent, the owning of him for his Lord, and his prayer for mercy, beſides all his former repentance? which, as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was both poſſible and probable; was all this we ſay as no workes and fruits of his faith? we may juſtly queſtion whether the Vindicator hath ever ſhewed ſuch fruits of his repentance, and evidences of a true faith: howbeit you ſee he makes much of this thief, alledging him again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as if he would fulfil the proverb, <hi>Similis ſimili, &amp;c.</hi> And-<hi>Baſil,</hi> quoth he, <hi>de humilitate</hi> ſaith; <hi>This is to glory in the Lord, when a man doth not boaſt of his own righteouſneſs; but acknowledgeth himſelf deſtitute of righteouſneſs, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied onely by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>] Who doth not ſo? yet do we not relie upon a falſe and meer imagined righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in Chriſt, as the Vindicator doth. [Thirdly, the material cauſe of our juſtification paſſively conſidered, ſaith he, or the perſons to whom juſtification belongs (theſe are rather ſubjects and objects, then a material cauſe) are thoſe <hi>ſheep of Chriſt that are known of him</hi> (of whom no doubt a great part are fully juſtified already) <hi>and he known to them; that hear his voice, and follow him, whom he predeſtinated to life, and elected before the foundation of the world,</hi> Rom. 8.30. <hi>Moreover, whom he did prodeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called thoſe he juſtified</hi> (in a ſanctifying way)
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29469:82"/>
                  <hi>and whom he juſtified he glorified.</hi> And <hi>Rodolph,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in Levit lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>That the blood of the High Prieſt</hi> (was the High. prieſt wont to be ſlain then?) <hi>was the expiation of the ſin of all believers; and ſo Chriſt hath taken away not onely the original ſin, but alſo all actual ſins, in reſpect of the guilt, puniſhment, and dominion of ſin;</hi> but not in reſpect of the corruption and pollution of ſin, which ſtill remaineth in the beſt Saints.] But this <hi>Rodolphus</hi> is not a good <hi>Agricola;</hi> for ſo Chriſt, who came to <hi>perfect or preſent his Church holy and without blemiſh before God,</hi> ſhould have the worſt thing and that which of all other is moſt hateful to God, namely the pollution of ſin to be left behind; which to ſay is blaſphemy againſt him. [And beſides this, ſaith he out of <hi>Haymo</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them everlaſting life,</hi> (and to none other doth juſtification belong, ſaith he) and the reaſons may be theſe; All thoſe that be juſtified (in full) ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; <hi>for whom he juſtified them he glorified, Rom.</hi> 8.30. But all men ſhall not be glorified, becauſe the kingdome of heaven ſhall be given but onely <hi>unto them for whom it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, Matth.</hi> 20.23. Secondly, (but that Text ſpeaketh of ſitting at Chriſts right hand or left) Chriſt is called Jeſus, for that <hi>he ſhould ſave his people from their ſins</hi> (that is, none at all fully, according to his doctrine) <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. But though all men are his people <hi>jure creationis,</hi> ſaith he, that is, by right of creation, yet all men are not his people <hi>jure donationis,</hi> given him to be redeemed (from their ſins and corruptions) <hi>for of them thou gaveſt me I have loſt none,</hi> (yes, the Son of perdition, <hi>John</hi> 17.12.) <hi>And ye believe not,</hi> faith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, Joh.</hi> 10.26. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall not juſtifie all men thereby to ſave them from their ſins.] But whoſe fault is that? Chriſts or theirs? for he invites <hi>all that are weary and heavy laden</hi> to come unto him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the bride ſay Come, and let him that heareth ſay Come; and whoſoever will let him take of the waters of life freely.</hi> Yea, though <hi>no man can come unto Chriſt unleſs the Father which ſent me draw him, and thoſe he will raiſe up at the laſt day, John</hi> 6.44. yet who is it that the Father doth not draw; firſt to himſelf if
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29469:82"/>he will come, and after to his Son, to be juſtified and ſaved by him? <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.3, 4. <hi>I taught Ephraim alſo to go, taking them by their armes, but they knew not that I healed them; I drew them with the cords of a man, even with the bonds of love, and I was to them as they that tooke off the yoke, and I laid meat before them.</hi> See <hi>Job</hi> 33.29, 30. <hi>ſo all theſe things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his ſoul from the pit, to be enlightned with the light of the living:</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 36.10, 11. <hi>He openeth alſo their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity; if they obey and ſerve him they ſhall ſpend their dayes in proſperity, and their years in pleaſure: but if they obey not, they ſhall periſh by the ſword, and they ſhall die without knowledge.</hi> And Chriſt, <hi>who taſted death for every man, Heb.</hi> 2.9. ſaith of the Jews (and might do it of others alſo whom he and his Father draweth) <hi>John</hi> 9.40. <hi>and ye will not come unto me that ye may have life:</hi> but men are in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner given unto Chriſt by the Father, when they are firſt converted by him, and after brought to believe on the Son for ſalvation from all their ſpiritual enemies, <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 46.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the formal cauſe of our juſtification paſſively conſidered, ſaith he page 75. is the particular application of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt (which in his ſenſe is <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum informe</hi>) unto every ſaithful ſoul.] But is this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation an act or paſſion? [wherein two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, ſaith he; firſt, that faith muſt apply unto us all the benefits that Chriſt hath effected for us.] Is the work done to our hands? is he to effect nothing in us for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? [Secondly, that every man in particular muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe things unto himſelf; (if he deſires to be deluded as he is:) for the firſt, ſaith he, this is one of the manifeſt differences betwixt the faith of Gods elect (of which he knows little or nothing) and the faith of Devils and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; that the godly do apply unto themſelves all the benefits of Chriſt,] Or rather do apply themſelves to the ſeeking of the ſame according to the promiſes. [and the other know them, but have not true grace to apply them.] But what are they, wiſe men or fools, that believe every
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29469:83"/>vain word and doctrine of men which hath no ground in the Scripture? <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15. <hi>The ſimple believeth every word, but the prudent take heed to their going;</hi> [for ſo ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> ſaith he, and <hi>Peter Lumbard lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Senten. diſtnct.</hi> 23. <q>That there is a great difference between him that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt, and him that doth believe in Chriſt; for the Devils believe Jeſus to be Chriſt,</q> but they believe not in Chriſt.] And may not ſome believe amils in Chriſt, as he doth? [Becauſe, ſaith he, it is one thing to believe God, another thing to believe there is a God, and another thing to believe in God.] (yea, and another thing to believe lies.) To believe God, as he ſaith, is to believe that he ſpeaks the truth in the Scriptures; and to believe God is to believe a God is: But to believe in God is to believe with love, and loving him to go unto him, and to cleave unto him, to be made one with him, to dwel in him, and have him dwel in us.] Whence it will follow that the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator never yet believed rightly in God. [And this is that faith by which a ſinful man is inſtrumentally juſtified (in Gods way, and not his) and is both found and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous in Gods ſight.] And hath not the faith of the Devil, the father of lies, the contrary effect hereunto. [For the ſecond, ſaith he, we muſt underſtand that this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of faith, or of Chriſt through faith, muſt be particularly applied (what muſt the application be applied?) by every man unto himſelf (if he deſires to be led hood-winked by the noſe) and that in a moſt ſpecial manner (even he) Becauſe a general faith (no nor a phanatick faith, ſuch as his is) is not thought juſtifying faith; for <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth that <hi>Agrippa did believe the Prophets, Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. and yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> confeſſeth he was no Chriſtian] And herein he was the honeſter man, then in words to confeſs him, and inworks to deny him as ſome Vindicators do. [And a natural man, ſaith he, by the force of Reaſon may be reduced to believe and acknowledge a God, and that this God is powerful, juſt, and true; and therefore brought to a general perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the truth of things to be believed, and yet all this faith (no nor his own to boot) is not ſufficient to juſtifie
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29469:83"/>us, becauſe true juſtifying faith is no natural quality (nor phanatical notion) but a ſupernatural gift of God, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. howbeit it were no hard thing to prove that ſome of the heathen underſtood Gods work of juſtification better then the Vindicator; witneſs that of <hi>Catullus</hi> the poet:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Omnia fanda, nefanda, malo permiſta furore,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Juſtificam nobis mentem avertêre Deorum.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Things good and bad, mixt with a fury blind,</l>
                     <l>Have turn'd away Gods juſt juſt making-mind. [or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying mind.]</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the general faith of the Scriptures, ſaith the Vindicator, is not ſufficient to make us Chriſtians; but as we read, the Saints of God do apply the promiſes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto themſelves (or rather themſelves unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes) to ſeek them in a right way, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, to wit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong experimental deliverances, <hi>God is my rock and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth:</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> (after that Chriſt was formed in her) <hi>my ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in God my Saviour, Luk.</hi> 1.47. and <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith, <hi>my Lord and my God,</hi> Joh. 21. and <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>] But what promiſes be or are contained in theſe Texts? [ſo muſt, ſaith he, every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that looks for ſalvation apply (we ſay lay hold of in particular) the grace and favour of God unto himſelf; and his faith inſtrumentally juſtifies (or may be a help unto him) the ſinner.] what without ſeeking of juſtifying and cleanſing grace? [Laſtly, the final cauſe of our juſtification paſſively conſidered (or the effect of it rather) is peace of conſcience in this life, and the atonement (a new expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but let it paſs) of eternal happineſs in the life to come: the firſt whereof, ſaith he, is attained by two ſpecial things; firſt, by an aſſured perſwaſion that all our ſins are forgiven:] (But may not ſome have a falſe perſwaſion in this kind?) [ſo being juſtified by faith (that is, in a ſanctifying and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative way) from all our ſins which we have committed,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29469:84"/>we have peace towards God through Jeſus Chriſt] for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwiſe, namely in his Son, our juſtification is but a dream. [Secondly, ſaith he, by an unwearied ſtudy to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtream (which in his ſenſe of impoſſibility is truly and properly ſpoken) of our own natural corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,] and why not againſt all temptations alſo? [and to keep a conſtant courſe (which he denyed heretofore to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) in the ways of godlineſſe; for Chriſt, ſaith he, gave himſelf for us to die for us, (and not by his Spirit to redeeme us from all iniquity) <hi>and did bear our ſins on his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon the tree;</hi>] But for what end? [<hi>that we being dead unto ſin ſhould live unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. or as Zachary ſaith, Luk. 1.74, 75. And ſo St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith <hi>that Chriſt died for the wicked, not that they ſhould remain wicked, but that they being juſtified through faith ſhould be converted from their wickedneſſe, and bring forth the fruits of holineſſe;</hi> becauſe (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith alſo) <hi>grace juſtifieth that we ſhould live juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>] But here the Vindicator is ſo blind that he brings <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> againſt himſelfe; for he takes the word juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we do, for purging away of ſin, and making of man juſt, holy, and good, by way of ſanctification, which is an uſual acception of the word among the Fathers. [The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond end of our juſtification, ſaith he, is the eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe which ſhall be attained hereafter when Chriſt ſhall ſay unto all his juſtified Saints (made juſt and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by his ſanctifying ſpirit) <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 25.34. And ſo much, ſaith he, for all the cauſes of our, juſtification <hi>actively</hi> and <hi>paſſively</hi> conſidered.] Wherein he hath given us <hi>non cauſas &amp; mutilas pro veris,</hi> falſe cauſes for true, eſpecially inſtead of the formall and material cauſes, not much unſuitable to his deceitful juſtification; but the efficient and final cauſes are for the moſt part applicable to the true work of juſtication. [And this, ſaith he, I hope may ſuffice] but it muſt be among ſuch as are blind, or are willing to be deluded [for the proof of the truth of this laſt branch of the ſecond poſition, that we are only juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. Which point being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood hath been and ſhall be better confirmed by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29469:84"/>us. I ſhall end, ſaith he, with that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. <hi>The word which I have ſpoken ſhall judge you in the laſt day.</hi>] Yea, and judgeth and convinceth the Vindicator al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to be a blind guide, a ſtranger to the faith of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and no other Apoſtle then a veterator, or impoſtor, as we ſhall in our <hi>cataſceuaſtical</hi> or affirmative part of our diſcourſe more fully manifeſt. [But he concludes with his form of prayer, I pray God to enable us all to <hi>hold the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace,</hi> and that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all thoſe doctrines that ſet up any thing of man] And much more, ſay we, do tend to the ſetting up of <hi>Satan</hi> or his kingdom [to the abaſing of Chriſt [and that we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thoſe doctrines which abaſe man,] and much more whatſoever is of the devil [and which exalt the Lord, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Not unto us, O Lord, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us</hi>] and much leſſe unto the Devil [<hi>but unto thy name, and unto that only give the glory, Pſalm</hi> 15.] Unto all which we ſay (and that not formally, but cordially) Amen.</p>
               <p>You ſee the Vindicator hath cloſed (like a Saint of the Phariſaicall ſect) with a prayer even as ſpecious in words of Scripture-phraſe, as his Preface was to his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved friends placed in the front of his Vindication; but when his prayer is explained to you in reference to his poſition, <hi>That ſinne will remain in the beſt of Saints as long as they live,</hi> then it will appear to have the ſame ſcope and end to his ſaid poſition as we have declared his Preface had.</p>
               <p>For whom can he mean and include in the relative word <hi>us,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>I pray God enable us,</hi> but the Levites his friends, and other his allies with himſelfe? For be it known to all men by theſe preſents, that we diſown his Tenents, and reſolve to ſpeak againſt them, <hi>dum maneat Lacheſi quod torqueat,</hi> to ſpeak until we lack breath, if we have opportunity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if to hold the unity of the Spirit be intended in reference to his poſition, then theſe words muſt ſignifie to hold the oneneſſe of the wicked ſpirit; for <hi>all ſin is of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. therefore to pray (in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29469:85"/>reference aforeſaid) to hold the unity of the Spirit, is to pray to hold the oneneſſe of the wicked ſpirit in upholding and maintaining with one affection, <hi>that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to hold it in the bond of peace is to pray (in reference to the foreſaid poſition) that in the oneneſſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the wicked ſpirit, that he and his friends may in all tyes, bonds, obligations of a quiet and peaceable agreement be bound together to maintain, <hi>that ſin will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the beſt of Saints as long as they live;</hi> and not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb one another, as thoſe foreſaid falſe Prophets do diſturb them who deny their poſition.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Vindicator prayeth (as ignorantly as he can, if he maintain his poſition) that he and his friends may renounce all the doctrine that ſets up any thing of man, to the abaſing of Chriſt; for if he intend that clauſe of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titionary note in reference to our doctrine of a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a total mortification of ſinne in this life, then his prayer is, that nothing of man, that is of us, (in contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to himſelfe and his friends) may be ſet up to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of all ſin, and ſo to abaſe Chriſt by a total mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, (if he mean to prefer his own petition before our doctrine) tendeth <hi>(abſit blaſphemia dicto)</hi> to the abaſing of Chriſt. But if he iutend to maintain to the end (as he begun) <hi>that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live,</hi> then the ſaid clauſe of his vote and prayer is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf and his poſition; for doth any doctrine ſet up any thing of man, but that Doctrine which maintaineth the neceſſary continuance of ſin in this life? for only <hi>ſinne,</hi> and allſin, <hi>is of the Devill</hi> and man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>by one man ſinne came into the world:</hi> and 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3. the devil or wicked one (what ever men dream to the contrary) is called <hi>the man of ſin:</hi> therefore for the Vindicator to pray that no doctrine be owned, but renounced, that ſets up any thing of man, is to pray againſt his own poſition, <hi>that ſin will remain in the beſt Saints as long as they live;</hi> becauſe only ſinne, and all ſinne, is from man, as aforeſaid. And
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29469:85"/>is there any thing which abaſeth Chriſt but ſins conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance? when as the Lord complaineth, <hi>thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, and wearied me with thine iniquities, Iſai.</hi> 43.24.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo upon the ſame account that the doctrine of ſins remaining, is the ſetting up of man, and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſt, we ſay: here alſo the clauſe of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>And that we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thoſe doctrines that abaſe man, and exalt the Lord,</hi> is a prayer for the embracing our doctrines becauſe a total mortification of ſin in this life is it which exalteth Chriſt in his holineſſe, will, and power, to deſtroy all ſin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>James</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>for the Lord offereth more grace,</hi> that is, to overcome it: See <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>who came to redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> Titus 2.14. <hi>that the Lord may be exalted alone in that day, Iſai.</hi> 2.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not unto us, Lord, Pſal.</hi> 115.19. (in a better ſenſe then the Vindicator doth apply thoſe words in reference to his prayer relating to his poſition;) <hi>but unto thy name be the glory,</hi> who haſt in ſome meaſure made known to us, and made us to believe the true doctrine which abaſes man, and exalts Chriſt; which doctrine is a poſſibility of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal mortification of ſin in this world.</p>

               <p>Firſt, we affirm that there is a poſſibility (through the grace and help of Chriſt) of a total mortification of ſin in this life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that there is a poſſibility of perfect obedience (through the grace and help of Chriſt) to the Law of God in this life.</p>
               <p>It is true, that if theſe two aſſertions be not coincident, yet they conſequently follow each other, ſo that to prove one of them is to confirm the other; for if ſin by the grace of Chriſt be rooted out in this life, what hinders but the Law of God may be here (by the ſame grace) fulfilled? yea to be ſo fulfilled; as to be juſtified thereby, and that through Chriſt of grace given? and if the Law of God may be ſo far fulfilled here through the grace of Chriſt, as not tooffend againſt the ſame, then doubtleſſe all ſins may be rooted out here by the ſame grace: yet we ſhal confirm each of them apart with their reſpective branches, both by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane authority, ſo fully and clearly, that ſcarce any Article of the Chriſtian faith ſhall have more evidence of truth and piety to plead for it, then our poſitions ſhall produce for themſelves. And firſt, for the former of them, That all ſin and corruption may be and ought to be in this life by the grace and help of Chriſt purged and rooted out
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29469:86"/>of the Saints; which we ſhall evince by many Topick places: And firſt, from Gods expreſſe commandements, which if they were not poſſible by grace to be performed were not only unjuſt and unlawful, but would be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their end, which is obſervance, and accompliſhment; and the Author of them would be argued of the want of wiſedome or equity, and of tyranny and cruelty. Of which ſort are theſe among many other.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29469:91"/>which firſt <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and then Chriſt and his Apoſtles, publiſhed to be at hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.21. and 4.17. which accordingly came to the Saints which waited for it in a right way.</p>
               <p>Revela. 12.10. <hi>And I heard a loud voice in heaven</hi> (the Church of God, wherein he dwels) <hi>ſaying, Now is come ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrength, the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt; for the accuſer of our brethren is caſt out who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them before God day and night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In hope of this kingdom, and in order thereunto, the Saints to whom it was publiſhed purified their hearts by faith in Gods ſanctifying grace to be had in Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, 3, <hi>Beloved, now are we the ſons of God, and it doth not appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him, or we ſhall ſee him as he is: and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that hath this hope in him purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi> Act. 15, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Men and brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth ſhould hear the word of the Goſpel, and beleive; and God which knoweth the hearts bare them witneſſe, giving the Holy Ghoſt unto them even as he did unto us, and put no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and us, purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> Out of this faith and hope the ſouls of Gods elect do cry unto God night and day for vengeance againſt Gods ſpiritual enemies and theirs, who firſt had crucified Chriſt in them, and by them, and afterwards did cruciate and vex them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual temptations and aſſaults. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. <hi>And he ſpake a parable unto them, to this end, that men always ought to pray and not to faint, ſaying, There was in a City a Judge that feared not God, neither regarded man, and there was a widow in that City; and ſhe came unto him, ſaying, avenge me of mine adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and he would not for a while but afterwards he ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet becauſe this widow troubleth me I will avenge her, leſt by her continuall coming ſhe weary me. And the Lord ſaid, hear what the unjuſt Judg ſaith and hall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and hight, though he bear long with them,? I tell you that he will avenge them ſpeedily. Nevertheleſſe when the Son of man
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:29469:91"/>cometh ſhall he find faith upon earth?</hi> Where now is this faith of Gods elect to be found? yea where is the faith of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and their Churches to be heard or read of, who looked for no life and glory by Chriſt, unleſſe they died with Chriſt unto all known ſin? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. <hi>For if we be dead with him then we believe that we ſhall live with him:</hi> and the doctrine which held forth that and no other way for the fallen man to enter into life, the Apoſtle commends as a faithful and undeceivable word; implying that the contrary doctrine and perſwaſions deceive mens ſouls in the end. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 11.12. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, if we be dead with Chriſt we ſhall live with him, if we ſuffer with him</hi> (dying to ſin) <hi>we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> If we deny him in this way he will alſo deny us.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Topick is the inequality between ſin and Gods grace now to be had of Chriſt Jeſus thereagainſt. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 5.4.11. <hi>No weapon that is formed againſt the Lord ſhall proſper, and every tongue that raiſeth up againſt thee in judgment thou ſhalt condemne; This is the heritage,</hi> and ſo forth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. <hi>For if by one</hi> (or one mans offence) <hi>death reigned by one, how much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteouſneſs ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> verſ. 20, 21. <hi>Moreover, the law entred that the offence might abound, but where ſin abounded grace did ſuperabound; that as ſin had reigned unto death, even ſo grace might reign through righteouſneſs unto eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eighth Topick is the profeſſed reſolution of the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles time to die unto all ſin.</p>
               <p>Rom. 6.1. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we continue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid. How ſhall we that are dead to ſin</hi> (namely by Chriſtian profeſſion and reſolution) <hi>live any longer therein?</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The ninth Topick is from the true end and uſe of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to teach us this death and burial of ſin in conformity to Chriſts death and reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Rom. 6.3, 4. <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us as are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29469:92"/>into Jeſus Chriſt were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk</hi> (after we are dead and riſen again with him) <hi>in newneſs of life; for if we have been planted into the likeneſs of his death we ſhall alſo be planted into the likeneſs of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Cor. 15.29. <hi>Elſe what ſhall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The tenth Topick is from the admiſſion and aſſertion of this mortified and purged eſtate every where.</p>
               <p>Rom. 8.2. <hi>For the law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus hath freed me from the law of ſin and death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rom. 6.7. <hi>For he that is dead is</hi> (juſtified, or) <hi>freed from ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt</hi> (according to the Spirit) <hi>he is a new creature; old things are paſt away, and all things are become new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gal. 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt; nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>

               <p>Chap. 5.24. <hi>And they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eleventh Topick is from the omnipotency of true faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Marth 15.18. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chap. 21.21. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, if ye have faith and doubt not, ye ſhall not onely do this which is done to the fig-tree, but alſo if you ſhall ſay unto this mountain,</hi> (of ſin) <hi>be thou removed, and be thou caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea, it ſhall be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark 9.23. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, if thou canſt believe all things are poſſible unto him that believeth.</hi>

               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:29469:92"/>
               <p>John 14.12. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me the works that I do ſhall he do alſo, and greater works then theſe ſhall he do, becauſe I go to the Father.</hi> Unto which joyn that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world,</hi> even Satans world, which ye through faith ſhall be by me enabled to overcome. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith; for who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Topick ſhall be the ſumme of all practical truth in Chriſt, which <hi>Paul</hi> reduceth to two heads.</p>
               <p>Epheſ. 4.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. as was ſaid before; <hi>But ye have not ſo learned Chriſt, if ſo be ye have heard him, and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jeſus, that ye put off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former converſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Thus much for divine authority; now for humane: we ſhall firſt produce divers of the Fathers, and ſome of thoſe which the Vindicator or his friends for him have alledged againſt us to out-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance him; and then the authority of our own Church (the beſt reformed of all the Proteſtant Churches) in her eſtabliſhed doctrine, and late Liturgie. For the firſt of theſe; <hi>Juſtin Martyr in quaeſt. &amp; reſpon. ad Orthodoxos; All men do ſin, not becauſe we cannot do otherwiſe:</hi> which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from hence, becauſe all men are not intangled with all ſorts of ſins, but ſome fall into theſe offences, ſome into others; and ſome men are involved with many ſins, ſome with fewer, and ſome with none at all; thoſe of whom I ſpake before, to wit <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

               <p>Thus for the Teſtmony of the Fathers; of which ſort we ſhall alledge more in the confirmation of the ſecond poſition. Now for the doctrine of our Engliſh reformed Church heretofore eſtabliſhed by law; Firſt, in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm is thus demanded and anſwered:</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What did your Godfathers and Godmothers then for you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They did promiſe and vow three things in my name; firſt, that I ſhould forſake the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanity of this wicked world, and all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh. Secondly, that I ſhould believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian faith. And thirdly, that I ſhould keep Gods holy will and commandements, and walk in the ſame all the dayes of my life.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doſt thou not believe that thou art bound to believe and to do all as they have promiſed for thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily, and by Gods help ſo I will, and I heartily thank our heavenly Father that he hath called me unto this ſtate of ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour: and I pray God to give me his grace that I may continue in the ſame unto my livesend. And afterwards reciting the Lords prayer:</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What deſireſt thou in this prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:29469:94"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I deſire my Lord God, who is the giver of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſend his grace unto me and unto all people, that we may worſhip him, ſerve him, and obey him as we ought to do, &amp;c. And that it would pleaſe him to ſave and defend us in all dangers Ghoſtly and bodily: and that he will keep us from all ſin and wickedneſs, and from our Ghoſtly enemy, and from everlaſting death, And this I truſt he will do of his mercy and goodneſs through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore I ſay Amen. And afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the inward and ſpiritual grace ſignified therein?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A death unto ſin, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that our Church prayed thus at the baptiſm of infants; <hi>And humbly we beſeech thee to grant that to</hi> (the perſon baptiſed) <hi>he being dead unto ſin, and living unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and being buried with Chriſt in his death, may crucifie the old man, and utterly aboliſh the whole body of ſin.</hi> And now we hope that the Vindicator had not renounc'd his baptiſm by ſinful poſitions and his own wicked courſe of life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in our late Liturgie we are taught thus to pray in the Collect on Eaſter-Tueſday, and to like effect in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almighty God, which haſt given thine onely Son to die for our ſins, and to riſe again for our juſtification; grant us ſo to put away the leaven of malice and wickedneſs, that we may alwayes ſerve thee in pureneſs of living and truth, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which we might adde that out of the Letanie:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From all evill and miſchief, and ſin, from the crafts and aſſaults of the Devil, from thy wrath, and from everlaſting damnation, Good Lord deliver us. From all blindneſs of heart, from guile, vain-glory and hypocriſie, from envy, hatred, and ſtrife, from all uncharitableneſs, Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From fornication and all other deadly ſin, and from all deceits of the world, the fleſh, and the Devil, Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the confirmation of the firſt poſition. Come we now to the eſtabliſhment of the ſecond; That the law of God may by the grace and help of Chriſt be ſo
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29469:94"/>perfectly kept and fulfilled in this life, as not to offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame, yea as to be juſtified, and that only by Chriſt of grace given: whch we will divide into two branches; and firſt prove the poſſibility of ſuch a fulfilling by the like Topicks and authorities as we did the former; and then briefly ratifie that which will follow by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, namely that by ſuch a fulfilling of the Law by the grace of Chriſt we may be juſtified before God and men, according to the truth of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, we take it for granted that the Law of God requireth no more of us then what is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe two commandements, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.36, 37, 38, 39. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind; this is the firſt and the great commandement: and the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> Becauſe our Saviour ſaith verſ. 40. <hi>On theſe two commandements hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our firſt Topick to prove all this attainable by grace is taken from Gods predeſtination and election. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>I have choſen and ordained you that you ſhould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould remain.</hi> Rom. 8.29, 30. <hi>For whom he did foreknow them he did predeſtinate to be made conformable to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt born among many brethren: moreover, whom he did predeſtinate thoſe he alſo called, and whom he called thoſe he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſtified thoſe he alſo glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Epheſ. 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love:</hi> and chap. 2.10. <hi>For we are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God had before ordained that we ſhall walk in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Pet. 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God in holineſſe unto obedience</hi> (and in order thereunto) <hi>unto the ſprinkling of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, his ſanctifying Spirit, as ſhall be proved hereafter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Topick is from Gods expreſſe commands, which cannot be impoſſible, for they ſhould be fruſtrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, tyrannical, or unjuſt, as aforeſaid.</p>

                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.18, 19. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou' ſhouldſt keep all his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made in praiſe and in honour, that thou mayſt be an holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath ſpoken. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6, 7, 8.

The Lord is well pleaſed for his righteouſneſſe ſake, he will magnifie the Law and make it honourable. Which it would not be if it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. chap. 48.17, 18. Thus faith the Lord thy redeemer, the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way which thou ſhalt go: O that thou hadſt harkened to my commandements! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteouſneſſe as the waves of the ſea. <hi>chap.</hi> 51.4, 5.

                     <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.32, 33, 34. Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and with the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> ſaith the Lord, not according to the covenant which I made with their Fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of Egypt, which my covenant they broke, although I was an Husband unto them, (or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt overule them) ſaith the Lord; but this ſhall be the covenant which I will make with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> After thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people: And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord, for I will forgive their iniquities, and remember their ſins no more.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Where take notice of theſe things; that the firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is a covenant of works, and the effect a compulſive obedience out of fear of vengeance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the ſecond covenant is made to thoſe that now love God and righteouſneſſe, and obey it out of good will, after the days of compulſion are ended, which muſt have their foregoing work to break mans ſtrong luſts and inclinations to ſin; after which comes the revelation of free mercy and ſalvation out of grace, unexpectedly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed from Heaven, to the loſt, yet humbled penitent, and praying or deprecating ſoul, which melts his heart with godly ſorrow, and inflames his heart with love to God, and righteouſneſſe, and with an hatred of all known ſin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that this ſecond covenant is of ſanctification, and then of ſome degree of glory. As to the former, the Lord promiſeth <hi>to put his Law into our inward parts,</hi> and to work the ſame in our hearts; which is done no other way but by regeneration, and by the promiſed Spirit of Chriſt,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29469:96"/>
                  <q>which is called the blood of the new covenant, and the blood of the everlaſting covenant for the purging,</q> or the dimiſſion away of our ſins; whereof both the expiative and conſecrating blood of the old Teſtament was a figure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.8. and 14.14, 10. and <hi>chap.</hi> 8.23, 24. and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in the New Teſtament is a ſign and repreſentation, as the bread broken is a repreſentation both of his word to be broken, received and eaten, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.16. and of his ſuffering pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and weakneſs, which is a body of his to be broken unto us by degrees, and received by faith and obedience, where through we may remember Chriſts death, and follow him therein, crucifying ſin till he come unto us in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power of his reſurrection. Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, '<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt (this Spirit, and ſpiritual blood of Chriſt) <q>who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf (as man) without ſpot to God, purge the conſciences (or ſouls) from dead works, to ſerve the living God? And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. He that falls from grace counts the blood of this covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was ſanctified, an unholy thing (or a thing of ſmal price) and ſo doth deſpite to the Spirit of grace:</q> and hence it is that the Apoſtle prayeth, <q>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. that God who brought again from the dead the Lord Jeſus, that great ſhepherd of the ſheep, would through the blood of the everlaſting covenant make the believing Hebrews perfect in every good work to do the will of the Lord;</q> as <hi>Peter</hi> alſo tells the Saints <q>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. that they were through the ſame redeemed or delivered from their vain converſation in a Jewiſh righteouſneſs received by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from their Fathers. This blood is promiſed unto them that walk in the light with God and his Saints, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all our ſin. With this blood the Saints waſhed their robes (or imperfect righteouſneſs) and made them white, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. with this Chriſt waſhed the Apoſtles, and made them Kings
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29469:97"/>and prieſts unto God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. for which they give him praiſe and glory; and with this is the Devil overcome and caſt out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A third thing obſervable in this covenant, is, that there is a clear, full, and glorious wiſdome promiſed to each Saint in due time, ſo that they ſhall not need to ſay to each <q>other, know the Lord, for they ſhall know him from the leaſt of them to the greateſt; for that perfect knowledge and love is then come which makes the imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prophecying to ceaſe,</q> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8, 9. Laſtly, the time of that perfect wiſdome, power, and love, is alſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, namely <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. in thoſe words, <q>for I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give their iniquities,</q> and remember their ſins no more: it is then when God hath purged and taken away all their ſins by the ſame blood: where forgiving of ſins (as in many other places) is to be underſtood of the purging them away by Gods grace, which we call dimiſſion, and that is the principal taking away of ſin, upon which the pardon, or taking away of the guilt follows of courſe, and is caſt in over and above, out of Gods abundant mercy for the death and ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. we have another of theſe promiſes of enabling grace; <q>Then will I pour clean water upon you, and from all your ſins and from all your idols will I cleanſe you; a new heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take the ſtony heart out of you, and I will give you an heart of fleſh, (that fleſh of Chriſt of which we ſpake before) and will put my Spirit within you, and I will cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my commandements and do them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.72, 73, 74, 75. To perform the mercy promiſed to our Fathers, and to remember his holy covenant, the oath which he ſwore to our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him all the dayes of our life. With which agrees that which follows, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 11.4. whereby exceeding
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29469:97"/>great and precious promiſes are given unto us, that by them we ſhould be partakers of the divine nature, having eſcaped the corruption that is in the world through luſt.</q> In both which places we may take notice that there are but two grand benefits promiſed in Chriſt, the firſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time and nature, is deliverance from our ſpiritual enemies, or our eſcaping out of corruption; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is a partaking of the divine nature; whereby we may ſerve God cheerfully and without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs all our dayes. Here is no mention made in theſe promiſes of the remiſſion of ſins, either becauſe it is an appendant to the firſt benefit, God taking away the guilt with the corruption and fault, or becauſe the Lord counts it ſo inconſiderable a benefit in compariſon of the other two that he makes no mention of it, but caſts it in over and above, as Chriſt ſpeaks, <q>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. Seek ye firſt the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſs, and all other things ſhall be added unto you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Topick ſhall be, That this full obedience through the grace and help of God is made the condition to the greateſt part of Gods promiſes, and his ſpiritual bleſſings in ſpecial.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. Now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant, ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto me above all people, for all the earth is mine, &amp;c. And <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20, 21, 22. Behold I ſend an Angel before thee (the Angel of the covenant) to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him not, for he will not pardon your tranſgreſſions, for my name (or being) is in him. But if thou ſhalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I ſpeak, then I will be an enemy to thine enemy, and an adverſary to thine adverſaries.</q> See <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.13. all manner of bleſſings are promiſed upon this ſcore. <q>

But what is the total righteouſneſs of the law? even to love God above thy ſelf, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf; which is not impoſſible unto thoſe men which apply their will and deſire thereunto. Wherefore that ſaying, By the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified, was not ſpoken or uſed by the Apoſtle becauſe we cannot perform impoſſibilities, but becauſe we will not frame our ſelves to do things poſſible.</p>

               <p>As for our reformed doctrine and Liturgie, thoſe places which we alledged before upon the former poſition will ſpeak to this alſo; <q>That as our Godfathers and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did promiſe and vow in our names, that we ſhould keep Gods holy will and commandements, and walk in the ſame all the dayes of our life; ſo we ſhould by Gods help reſolve ſo to do, and to that end ſeek his grace, that we may continue the ſame unto our lives end.</q> And afterwards, when the catechiſt had ſet forth the duties of the whole law in the firſt and ſecond table, he ſaith, My 'good child, know this, that thou art not able to do this of thy ſelf, (nor to walk in the commandements of God and to ſerve him) <q>without his ſpecial grace which thou muſt learn to call for at all times by diligent prayer,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the Liturgie, in the Collect upon the firſt Sunday after the <hi>Epiphanie,</hi> the Church was wont to pray thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Grant that theſe thy people may both perceive and know what things they ought to do, and alſo have grace and power faithfully to fulfill the ſame, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And beſides a prayer ſaid after every one of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, in the cloſe of all the Church prayed thus; <q>Lord have mercy upon us, and write all theſe thy laws in our hearts we beſeech thee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay nothing of the moſt learned Biſhops that were in their ages, Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Overal,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>White,</hi> with other Grandees and Fathers of our Church, King <hi>James</hi> upon the Lords prayer affirmeth, <q>that it is blaſphemy to ſay that any of Chriſts precepts are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for that were to give him the lie, who told us out of his own mouth, that his yoke is eaſie, and his burden light: And Chriſts intimate diſciple ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. that his commandements are not grievous.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the firſt branch of the ſecond poſition: now for the ſecond which follows thereupon; That by this righteouſneſs or obedience unto the law wrought by the grace of Chriſt we may be juſtified. Take theſe twelve things into conſideration; Firſt, that juſtification is one
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:29469:105"/>and the ſame thing with ſanctification in Jeſus Chriſt, as we have ſhewed out of many places of the Scriptures; as <q>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. But now ye are waſhed, now ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, now ye are juſtified in the name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. He ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and by the renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Saviour; that being juſtified by his grace we ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</q> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.11. where read the Text thus, as it ſignifies in the Greek; <q>Let him that is unjuſt be unjuſt ſtill, and he that is filthy be filthy ſtill; but he that is juſtified be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſtill,</q> and he that is ſanctified be ſanctified ſtill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that as we are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt <q>(<hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. among thoſe that are ſanctified by faith in me) ſo we are juſtified by faith in Chriſt; <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, as we are ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, ſo we are juſtified by that Spirit <q>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. But now ye are waſhed, but now ye are ſanctified, but now ye are juſtified in the name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, as ſanctification is taken for a waſhing away of ſin, ſo is juſtification alſo. <q>
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. And ſuch were ſome of you, but now ye are waſhed, but now ye are ſanctified, but now ye are juſtified. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſanctification is taken for a poſitive or infuſed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs or righteouſneſs, whereby the contrary unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is purged out: <q>1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3. For this is the will of God, even your ſanctification: and <hi>chap.</hi> 5.23. Now the very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly. So is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication uſed for an inherent holineſs and righteouſneſs; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45.24, 25. Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength; even unto him ſhall men come, and all that be in cenſed againſt him ſhall be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:29469:106"/>aſhamed; for in the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be juſtified (in way of inherent righteouſneſs and ſtrength communicated unto them, as was ſaid in the former verſe) and ſhall glory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, as this ſanctification is gradually attained, ſo is juſtification alſo. <q>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. He that is unjuſt let him be unjuſt ſtill, but he that is juſtified let him be juſtified ſtill, and he that is ſanctified let him be ſanctified ſtill,</q> that is, more and more; where juſtification and ſanctification are uſed for an inheſive holineſs, or righteouſneſs, as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, as ſanctification is communicated and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to make us obedient unto the law, that it may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by us, ſo is juſtification alſo; <q>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. Elect according to the foreknowledg of God, or through the ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and the ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, as forgiveneſs of ſins follows ſanctification, as an individual companion of thoſe ſins that are purged away by it, <q>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. that they may receive remiſſion of ſins, and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in me:</q> ſo that remiſſion of ſins is not juſtification, but an effect or concomitant of the ſame. <q>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth; who ſhall condemn?</q>
               </p>
               <p>So did our Church believe, and did pray for children and perſons to be baptized, ſaying, <q>Almighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal God, the aid of all that need, &amp;c. We call upon thee for theſe infants, that they coming to thy holy bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm may receive remiſſion of their ſins by ſpiritual rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, whereas our Saviour makes the new birth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation <q>
                     <hi>John</hi> 3.3. Verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that unleſs ye be born again ye cannot ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God:</q> ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> leaves out ſanctification in order of cauſes, unleſs ſanctification and juſtification be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29469:106"/>all one: <q>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate them he alſo called, and whom he called thoſe he juſtified, and whom he juſtified them he alſo glorified.</q> And ſo doth our Church in the 39. Article ſpeak of ſanctification under juſtification, or elſe leaves it out as needleſs; which were impiety in us to think: which is yet more clear out of the thirteenth Article, thus intituled. 'Of works before juſtification: The words of the article are theſe; <q>Works done before the grace of Chriſt, and the inſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, foraſmuch as they ſpring not of faith in Jeſus Chriſt, neither do they make us meet to receive grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, every grace and vertue of God whereby we perform obedience to Gods law is called a juſtification; and all the graces of the Saints are named as ſo many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular juſtifications: <q>

But whereas he ſaith, [that he is neither of note, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the unworthieſt among the thouſands of <hi>Levite,</hi>] we ſhall eaſily grant him the former; but for the latter, as he was never any of the tribe of <hi>Lovi,</hi> but by intruſion, and firſt in a mendicant and abuſive way: ſo if he had been one of that Tribe, he might have paſt for one of the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them, by reaſon of his lewd life; as no ſmall part of his doctrine here is the ſcumm of ignorance and infidelity. What he ſaith further, [that we in the publick congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (to wit, at our ſecond meeting) did beat down the truth of his poſitions, and ſeek to maintain the contrary,] he is miſtaken, it was to decry and overthrow the falſhood of the ſame, for we can truly ſay with the Apoſtle in our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>We can do nothing againſt the truth but for the truth:</hi> where notwithſtanding he tels us that the points in controverſie have been ſo fully and cleerly vindicated by the Worthies of our Church, (of which himſelf, nor we, ever ſaw any yet) and by our yet living Clergie (why did he then produce none of them?) that to any not puft up with ſpiritual pride admiſſion of additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſeem ſuperfluous and unneceſſary; then by his own words he muſt be convicted as one puft up with ſpiritual pride, whatſoever his coadjutors are; for he and they have made a large addition, if any thing in this kind was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant before. But whereas he tels us [that many people have been diſturbed and diſquieted (in their former opinions and purity) by reaſon of the audaciouſneſſe and impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29469:109"/>of the oppoſers of his tenents: we ſay it that we were, are, and we hope ſhall be, bold in the cauſe of God againſt ſin, and Satan, and the upholders of his kingdom; but we were never ſo audacious and impudent as himſelf, who in <hi>Suffolk</hi> changed his name, and called himſelf Doctor <hi>Kendall</hi> of <hi>Pembrook-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How beit we will uſe his pretended motives for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all incentives, who ſaith, and that truly therein, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of the people are not able to buy volumes, nor by reaſon of the weakneſſe of their capacities (and ſmall growth in grace) are able ſo readily to apprehend the clearneſſe and perſpicuity of the truth upon the hearing of them, nor yet clearly to diſtinguiſh betwixt them and falſhood vailed under truths svizard, we have therefore for their ſatisfaction (and the edification of all men) as alſo for the confirmation of the truth, preſented unto publick view ſome few collections, which being ſeriouſly weighed, conſidered, and digeſted, may by the bleſſing of God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the weakeſt, if willing, to diſcover truth from falſhood, Amen.</p>

Which is true of the Theatre of this world (where we hope they will act <hi>Iſraels</hi> part better then he hath hitherto done) and we will with him wiſh them to fight the good fight of faith, (which is not for ſin or Satan, as his Vindication tels us, but for Chriſt againſt both) and then we may as truly, as he doth deceitfully, aſſure them, you, and all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, that the victory ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, (more glorious then his hath been hitherto, or is likely to be hereafter, without a ſudden and earneſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:29469:109"/>
               <p>And now we crave leave to ſpeak a word or two to thoſe that have abetted the Vindicator, or do any way fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his doctrine; and therein to advertiſe them of theſe things in the name and bowels of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that this doctrine is not the Proteſtants doctrine, though it may be called a Proteſtant doctrine; for there are many diſtinct Churches, all whoſe faith and doctrine are called Proteſtant, becauſe in many things they proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> of which the Calviniſtical is the worſt, and moſt erroneous; the Lutherans is the next, and in ſome things more orthodox then the former: And the third is the ancient Engliſh reformed Proteſtant, which is far the beſt of all the three; for our Reformers deſired to tread in the footſteps of Antiquity, according to their beſt ſight and comprehenſion, which the other, and (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Calviniſts) were careleſſe to do, and in many things refractory thereagainſt: and though we in the point of original ſin may ſeem to differ from our Engliſh Church (which received that by tradition from many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) yet when occaſion ſhall ſerve, we ſhall make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that we have not only divine authority for that and other things alſo wherein we ſeem to ſome to be out of the common road, but we have the firſt Fathers of the Church, and the firſt reformers, as well as many of the latter, on our ſide: and what diſhonour will it bring to God, or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to parents whoſe children die in infancy, that we affirm that all children are now born without origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal taint or guilt, or why ſhould an allegoricall ſpeech, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. of our naturall and perſonall <hi>Adam,</hi> or an hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical ſpeech of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. ſo far impoſe upon us (though not rightly looked into by ſome others in many ages) as openly to contradict many other Scriptures vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Gods mercy and juſtice?</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this doctrine of the Vindicators which we oppoſe is bottomleſſe, like the place from whence it came, that is, it hath no foundation in the Scripture: whereas we have brought ſome hundreds of Texts, and might have brought more, to clear up the truth and piety
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29469:110"/>of our tenents; for we dare challenge all the Calviniſts in the world to prove any of theſe aſſertions, (upon which the contrary doctrine is built) by clear Texts of Scripture: Firſt, that we ſhall not be perfected in grace till the day of Iudgment, ſo as to <hi>be preſented without ſpot, or wrinkle, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing,</hi> whereas we have remonſtrated two things to the contrary, firſt, that many places which our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries underſtand of that day, ſpeak clearly of Chriſts ſecond coming to us in the Spirit and inner-man: and ſecondly, that we muſt be made holy and without blemiſh, not in that day, but before it, and in order unto it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.32. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14, 15. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. and ſecondly, that we ſhall not be perfected in grace, or the righteouſneſſe of ſanctification, untill we come into Heaven, or the full kingdome of God; for we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that juſtification, which is all one with ſanctification, muſt of neceſſity go before glorification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. and ſo muſt full obedience and doing of Gods will, if the Lord affords time and means be fore the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.

Deliver me O Lord from mine enemies, for I fly to thee, to hide me with thee; teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God: thy Spirit it is good, lead me unto the Land of uprightneſſe, and of thy mercy cut off all mine enemies, and deſtroy all them that afflict my ſoul. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10.

But alſo, ſaith he, they pray ſinfully who perſevere in ſin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that thoſe ſins of theirs ſhould be pardoned or put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Lord, which they themſelves have not put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them.</q> Seventhly, they ſay that there is not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther active obedience or righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by faith then that which Chriſt works in his Saints: for its contrary to <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.24, 25. and 48.18. and 53.11. and 59.17. and 61.3, 10, 11. and 62.1, 2. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.5, 6. and 31.31, 32, 33. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. and 5.7, 18, 19. and 8.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. Eighthly, that we are perfect in this life, and complete by juſtification, though not by ſanctification; wheres they are both one thing, as hath been proved at
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:29469:111"/>large: and while the one is imperfect the other is alſo. Ninthly, that juſtification lies in remiſſion of ſins, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the guilt of the ſame, yet leaving the ſin or pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution behind: whereas juſtification, taken in a liberative way, is a purging and waſhing away of the fault and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the firſt place; as hath been proved out of <hi>Acts</hi> 13.20. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider that the kingdome of God which Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached is not onely an inward kingdome, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21. as it is a kingdome both of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. and of glory alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18. but conſequently that there is an internal heaven of holineſs and glory to be had and obtained by the Saints in this life, <q>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. knowing that ye have in your ſelves a better and more induring ſubſtance in the heavens;</q> for ſo the words are in the Greek Text. As <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and fellow-Apoſtles, whom God hath raiſed up and <q>ſet together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</q> 
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5, 6. this is that kingdome which Chriſt taught his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple to pray for, ſaying, 'thy kingdome come; and which he and <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt publiſhed 'to be at hand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. and 4.17. and which '<hi>John</hi> ſaw coming down from God out of heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23. before whoſe coming all ſin muſt be purged away, for 'no unclean thing can enter into it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. yea all the ſpiriteal effects of ſin, as the ſecond day, ſorrow, crying and tears ſhall be removed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that they which know not, own not, nor wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this kingdome of God, with the way and means thereunto, were never ſent of God to preach the true Goſpel of the kingdome, but do publiſh their own imaginations and traditions of men, as the Vindicator, and many of far greater note then he, both living and dead, both do and have done.</p>
               <p>Fithly, that they who do not believe that he (God) will avenge his elect who cry unto him night and day for vengeance againſt their ſpiritual enemies for the rooting of all out, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1, 7. have not the faith of Gods elect; as hath been ſaid before.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:29469:112"/>
               <p>Sixthly, we ſhall leave it to your ſerious conſideration whether it be not the voice of the unbelievers, and not of the Saints, of whom it is ſaid, concerning the beaſt of ſin which came out of the ſea with ſeven heads and ten horns, ſaying, <q>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.4. and they worſhiped the dragon, who gave power unto the beaſt, and they worſhipped the beaſt, ſaying, who is like unto the beaſt,</q> who is able to make war with him? Which interpretation concerning the beaſt of ſin is not ours, but <hi>Arrias Montanus</hi> hath it, and that from a ſpecial Author alſo.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, we would not have it ſlightly paſſed over which is written, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.14. concerning the ten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing ſpies, who would neither encourage themſelves nor others to go and fight againſt the Canaanites, that ſo they might have inherited the promiſed land, but diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened themſelves and others with the apprehenſion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities, till they were excluded therefrom in the end; 'for whatſoever was written in time paſt was written for our inſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. and ſo was the ſtory of <hi>Bar-Jeſus, Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.6. who called himſelf <hi>Bar-Jeſus,</hi> that is, the Son of Jeſus, and pretended to become a prophet, but he oppoſed the true faith in Chriſt, as the Vindicator and ſome others do, ſeeking to turn away the Deputy <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> from it, and ſo perverted the right way of the Lord, being an enemy to the true righteouſneſs; in which regard, he is not onely called a falſe prophet, and a ſorcerer, as his name importeth, but ſmitten with blindneſs: from which ſin and all other, as well as from the horrid effects thereof, the Lord in his mercy preſerve us all; and let thoſe in ſpeciall find mercy at his hands, who oppoſing the truth have done it ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in unbeliefe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, that a great part of the Clergy in this nation, and no ſmal part of them in authority, begin to decline from the Orthodox faith of our Engliſh reformed Church, and to urge the rigid and turbulent opinions of Mr. <hi>John Knox,</hi> the father of the Gomariſts in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe doctrine and diſcipline in an hundred years ſpace hath not brought
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29469:112"/>forth ſo much reformation of life in that nation, as our late erected Government hath done there, though for the moſt part by awe and conſtaint.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that as this doctrine deviates from the Apoſtles faith, <q>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. for if we be dead with him, we believe that we ſhall live with him;</q> ſo it ſwerves from the right end of both the Sacraments; <q>for by baptiſm we are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the death of Chriſt, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up by the glory of the Father, even ſo we ſhould walk in newneſs of life: for if we have been planted together into the ſimilitude of his death, ſo then ſhall we be into the likeneſs of his reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. </q>and in the Lords ſupper we are <q>to ſhew forth the Lords death</q> (in dying with him unto all iniquity) <q>until his coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto us in the power of his reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.</q> Which two eſtates are by the Vindicators doctrine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as things of impoſſible attainment in this life; and ſo the ſumme of the Goſpel, the right belief and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian race, hereby denied, decried, and openly oppoſed in this Vindication, by which the Vindicator hath verified (as if his name were ominous in reference to his deſign) another anagram of his Name, <hi>O hindring net.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>God hath his net, and ſo hath the Devil,</l>
                  <l>Both nets are daily us'd about the evil:</l>
                  <l>Gods net draws fiſh out of the ſea of ſin,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Mare clauſum</hi> Satan caſts them in;</l>
                  <l>Where Satans drudger-man is ſtill impli'd</l>
                  <l>To watch, and draw Gods fiſh on his ſhore ſide;</l>
                  <l>This work to do, <hi>(John Tendring)</hi> he is ſet</l>
                  <l>To plead for ſin, hence call'd <hi>O hindring net.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>True Doctrine is Gods net; his fiſher men</l>
                  <l>Are miniſters of righteouſneſs, and then</l>
                  <l>Falſe doctrine muſt be Satans net to draw</l>
                  <l>Men from their due obſervance of Gods law;</l>
                  <l>By which they love to God and man forget:</l>
                  <l>And ſuch thy book doth prove, <hi>O hindring net.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:29469:113"/>
               <p>Having finiſhed alſo the <hi>cataſceuaſtical</hi> part of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vindication, in the next pirce we ſhall preſume to offer ſome Queries (becauſe we deſire to lay open our hearts and minds for the trueths cauſe) to ſuch as are held to cenſure and raſhly to judge of thoſe whom they beleive are contrary-minded unto themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Querie Whether do you or any of you pretend to an infallible Spirit, whereby you do not (nor can erre) in what you affirm or deny to be divine truth according to the Records, commonly called the Scriptures. The reaſon is, becauſe the late Synod confeſſed, <hi>cap.</hi> 31. of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that Councels and Synods have erred, as themſelves have done: elſe why do they not anſwer the <hi>Examen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it in the materal points, out of pity to the examiners, (who pitied them) to undeceive them and the well-meaning people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe if it be true, as aforeſaid, then why do the Committees for trying in one place, and ejection in every County, though ſome are more moderate then others, put the Article at the foot of other Articles, That he is ignorantand inſufficient for the work of the Miniſtry; when ſometimes the perſon the ſaid article is put upon, is a grave Doctor of Divinity, and may be their catechiſers Father for age in years and learning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe many are put out, (and others kept out) of a livelyhood in the way themſelves live and grow, with other additionals rich by, becauſe they cannot <hi>ex conſciencià</hi> ſubſcribe and own their maſters opinions, <hi>Et jurare in verba magiſtri;</hi> and yet theſe maſters by their own confeſſion may erre as their maſters did whoſe ſervants were the miſer men, <hi>John</hi> 7.45, 46, 47, 48, 49.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Querie: What do you aim at in your preaching with ſuch bitterneſs (eſpecially in <hi>Wilts</hi>) againſt us? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to maintain a combination and faction of ſelf inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or that the people you preach unto may live a peacable and moſt holy life, and their ſouls ſaved in the day of the Lord. The reaſon of this Querie is, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>James</hi> 1.14. <hi>If you have bitter envying and ſtrife
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29469:113"/>in your hearts glory not, alſo you lye againſt the truth:</hi> and verſ. 16. <hi>where envying and ſtrife is there is confuſion and every evil work:</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>and that the fruit of righteouſneſſe ſown in peace of them that make peace.</hi> Therefore Heb. 11.14. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>follow peace with all men, without which none ſhalt ſee God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Querie. Whether ſuch doctrines as hold out a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a total mortification of ſinne (through the grace and help of Chriſt) and a perfect obedience to the Law of God, are not the Doctrines which do perſwade people to live that moſt holy life, but lead men, as ſome have ſaid, from Heaven to Hell, <hi>if Hell</hi> be where no ſin nor unclean thing can come, and Heaven be where much ſinne will remain (it is confeſſed) according to the Vindicators atteſtation and poſition.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this Querie is offered, by reaſon we have heard from an intelligent and preſent hearer thereof, that a Miniſter in <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> (but it is ſaid he was late a <hi>New-England</hi> man) did pray to God in his ignorant real (before many people) that he might never believe ſuch a doctrine as a poſſibilty of a total mortification of ſin in this life. And we pray God of his mercy not to ſay Amen to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but pray unto the Lord Jeſus for him or ſuch-like, that he would intercede to his Father, ſaying, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Querie. Whether it be not intereſt, and ſelf-love in any, to maligne others for what they hold out to the world for doctrines according to godlineſſe, before the ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligning perſons do confute by plain Scriptures the ſaid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines held out to be contrary to godlineſſe; and likewiſe give the ſaid maligned perſons freedom and time to make reply and anſwer for themſelves: for you may ſee what <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 25.27.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Querie. Whether they do well, and do as they would be dealt with, who charge men for preaching poyſonfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, before they themſelves have heard ſuch kind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from them whom they charge with it; or have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome information from others, either <hi>viva voce,</hi> or under
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:29469:114"/>their hands, that the perſons charged have preached ſuch kind of doctrine.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Querie. Whether the holy Scriptures, commonly called the word of God, be not the rule, and the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornal rule, to confute all error, and confirm all truth by; becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>to the Law and to the teſtimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Querie. Whether an errour in Divinity be not a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-axiome commonly miſtaken, and not underſtood. As an Anabaptiſt (for ſo ſome are called by others of divided judgments) miſtook that Scripture-axiome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.25, 26. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them, and they who are great exerciſe authority over them; but it ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> From which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive particle <hi>(but)</hi> in the laſt clauſe, the ſaid perſon denied magiſtracy to be exerciſed over Chriſtians; for which cauſe he was (ſome years ſince, as its ſaid) impriſoned in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>-Caſtle, and indicted upon the next opportunity before the Judge of Aſſiſe for that County: Upon which Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he produced his Bible, and deſired the Judge that the place might be read, where it is ſaid, <hi>but it ſhall not be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who was moſt in fault for his ſaid opinion? the poor miſunderſtanding man, who out of conſcience did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the tranſlated Scripture, or they who did tranſlate the ſaid two verſes amiſſe, and ſo led him from the mind of Chriſt to the ſaid miſunderſtanding? for the words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Now the prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth ofttimes <hi>contrarium</hi> &amp; <hi>adverſus,</hi> being added to the verbs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, muſt make the ſaid verbes to ſignifie to abuſe and pervert their rule and authority; which was no doubt our Saviours meaning, when he ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>but it ſhall not be ſo among you,</hi> namely, not to abuſe any authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them; which is a good caveat to all Chriſtian magiſtrates to uſe their authority rightly and Chriſtian-like: according to which if the foreſaid words had been
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:29469:114"/>tranſlated, (as they ought to have been) the foreſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious man had (no queſtion) ſubmitted to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an magiſtrates, and ſo have been kept out of priſon; for who will not ſubmit to magiſtrates out of obediential love, while they exerciſe their ruling power and authority ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to rules of juſtice preſcribed by God, without reſpect of perſons, becauſe then there would be <hi>no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in our ſtreets?</hi> But ſaith Chriſt, <hi>wo be to them by whom offences come,</hi> Matth. 18.7.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Querie. Whether it be not the moſt compendious way of right judging every pretended divine controverſie, to put the ſaid controverſie into a Scripture-axiom or axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms; and conſider whether both parts (which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the ſubject and predicate) of the ſaid axiom be expreſly or equivalently contained in the Scripture: as for inſtance; It is ſaid by the Romaniſts, that <hi>Papa Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus eſt caput Eccleſiae, that the Pope of Rome is head of the Church:</hi> and, that, <hi>Maria eſt mediatrix gratiae,</hi> that <hi>Mary, Chriſts Mother, is the interceſſor to her Son</hi> for grace and help for us in time of need.</p>
               <p>Now its confeſſed that <hi>caput Eccleſiae,</hi> which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, or laſt part of the foreſaid axiom, is in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; but we cannot find the ſubject, or firſt part of the aforeſaid axiom <hi>(Papa Romanus)</hi> in the Scripture, which ſurely muſt be therein contained if ever we think to prove by Scripture that the Pope, of <hi>Rome</hi> is head of the Church. So muſt we find <hi>mediatrix gratiae</hi> in Scripture, the predicate or latter part of the ſecond axiom, before we do with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence affirm that <hi>Maria eſt mediatrix gratiae,</hi> that <hi>Mary</hi> is the interceſſor to her Son for grace to be given to us in our time of need: therefore why ſhould we believe the ſaid aſſertions for divine truths, when we cannot find thoſe axioms to be expreſly or equivalently laid down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Querie. Whether the ſenſe we put upon an axiom (expreſly laid down in Scripture) ought not to be proved to be expreſly or equivalently in ſome one Scripture or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Gods word, that ſo we may juſtifie our ſaid ſenſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:29469:115"/>of the axiom to be the very mind of Chriſt according to the Scriptures. As for inſtance; Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day:</hi> In which words are theſe two divine axioms:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is a Lords day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he that will preſume to fix his proper ſenſe upon the firſt axiom, affirming what is meant by the Lords day; or upon the ſecond axiom, what is meant to be <hi>in the Spirit on the Lords day;</hi> muſt not he firſt prove that his ſaid ſenſe is plainly declared in ſome Scripture or other to be a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-ſenſe, and ſo the mind of God? otherwiſe he may juſtly be queſtioned why he putteth ſuch a ſenſe upon the ſaid axiom, which the holy Scriptures do not expreſly hold out in ſome place or other of the ſaid Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And in caſe ſome other place of Scripture do fully declare his ſenſe of the axiom to be divine, (according to his aſſertion) yet he muſt prove by the context (if not by the text) of Scripture, that his ſenſe impoſed is the ſenſe and meaning of the axiom he hath laid down in the ſaid place; otherwiſe it had been much better for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to have choſen the axiom in Scripture which expreſly holdeth out his ſaid ſenſe, then to put a ſenſe upon an axiom which he cannot prove by the text, or context, to be the genuine ſenſe of the ſaid axiom.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe which too many Divines put upon Saint <hi>John</hi>'s words, is, that Saint <hi>John</hi> meaneth by the Lords day the firſt day of the week, which they call our Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath (in contradiſtinction to the Jews Sabbath) to be ſet apart as the Lords day, which we muſt ſolemnize and keep ſacred as a day to the Lord, (commanded by him) to be ſolemnized by all good Chriſtians in holy duties, as preaching the word, hearing the ſame, adminiſtring the Sacraments publickly with prayer and thankſgiving; and alſo ſpend the remainder of the day (vacant from publick duties) in private reading, prayer, and repetition of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:29469:115"/>
               <p>It is true (and we confeſs it) that the foreſaid duties are moſt needful to be practiſed by us; and that a day to do them in is moſt needfull to be appointed and aſſigned: and as for our ſelves we do profeſs to all whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that we are moſt ready to perform the ſame du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties enjoyned on the ſaid day in every capacity we ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto; yea we acknowledge our ſelves bound in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Scripture and Conſcience to obſerve the ſaid day (now ſet a part to be obſerved by this nation) from outward and bodily labours ſo farre as we can do it without tranſgreſſing ſome other command of God incumbent at that time upon us: and thus we acknowledge we ceaſe from our ſaid works, as a figurative Sabbath, which imports a ceſſation to reſt; and as an inſtruction to put our ſelves and others in minde to ceaſe from <hi>thinking of our own thoughts, words, and actions, Iſ.</hi> 58.13. which are our ſinful thoughts, words, and actions, as being moſt properly ours, becauſe Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>every man is drawn away of his concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, James</hi> 1.13, 14. which we muſt ceaſe from, that ſo at length <hi>we may come into the true reſt which is prepared for the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4.9.</p>
               <p>This is our confeſſion of faith in this particular afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and if the Chriſtian magiſtrates we are to live under, do appoint two ſuch Sabbaths aforeſaid in a week to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the nation, we are ready to do what is required of us accordingly in every capacity we ſtand in.</p>
               <p>But we ſtill querie the ſaid Divines, whether they can prove by text, or context, that Saint <hi>John</hi> in the foreſaid place (<hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10.) did mean by the Lords day the firſt day of the week; or whether the firſt day of the week is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in any place of Scripture in plain terms to be our Chriſtian Sabbath, and ſo to be uſed and ſet apart (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) for the Lords day.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what place is there in the New Teſtament which calleth the firſt day of the week the Lords day, for Chriſtians to obſerve, as the Lords day, in ceſſation from all bodily labours which are appointed for the benefit of the natural life? becauſe if there be no ſuch day ſpecified in the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29469:116"/>Scriptures, as aforeſaid, it is leſt to Chriſtian magiſtrates to order and appoint a day of ceſſation from bodily employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in reference to the performance of ſuch pious and needful duties aforeſaid, to the glory of God, and good of our ſouls; which muſt be cared for in ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and loſe his ſoul? Matth.</hi> 16.26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe if the ſaid day be ſet apart by God to the ends and purpoſes aforeſaid, and in ſuch a manner as is pretended, then we muſt be bold to tell the Chriſtian magiſtrate, that he hath no more liberty and authority to diſpenſe with any civil affaires to be done on that day, then any private man hath; unleſs there fall out ſome preſent and unavoidable neceſſity to tranſact ſome performances for the preventing or ſuppreſſing of ſome imminent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive miſchief. In other caſes we ſay (if it be as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) the Chriſtian magiſtrates muſt not allow and tolerate ſuch civil affairs to be done on the Chriſtian Sabbath, as are ordinarily and frequently allowed to be done; for Chriſt who ſaid, <hi>Give unto Caeſar the things which are Caeſars,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Give unto God the things which are Gods, Matth.</hi> 22.21.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe Chriſt-ſaith, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Let none teach for doctrines the traditions of men:</hi> hence all (eſpecially in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) muſt be wary how they publiſh any thing to be Gods mind, for to bind others to its obſervance, as the poſitive command of Jeſus Chriſt, unleſſe it be plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed according to their ſenſe in ſome Scripture-axiom or other; for as an axiom is onely true or falſe, ſo a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine axiom is always true.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Querie. In caſe it be a plain Scripture-axiom which is affirmed or denyed, whether then to find out the true meaning and ſcope of the ſaid Scripture-axiom as its trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, whether (we ſay) it be not requiſite, firſt, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the words of that axiom be rightly tranſlated out of the original tongue or language in which the axiom was firſt written, that is, whether the words of the axiom in the tranſlation do bear the ſame and as full a ſenſe as the words in the original do evidently import.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:29469:116"/>
               <p>Secondly, whether the verbs (if there be any in the ſaid axiom) be tranſlated in the ſame mood and tenſe which the original language will bear, and are uſually put into; when there is great reaſon (for to make good ſenſe) ſo to do.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.36. <hi>If they ſinne againſt thee,</hi> (<hi>for there is no man,</hi> ſaith our Tranſlation in the ſaid place, <hi>that ſinneth not</hi>) <hi>and thou be angry with them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe words in the parentheſis, <hi>(for there is no man which ſinneth not)</hi> are offered and premiſed as the reaſon of the hypotheticall axiom, <hi>if they ſinne againſt thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now its as true as an uſual ſaying, that <hi>hypotheſis nihil point in eſſe,</hi> a ſuppoſition doth not put the thing abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in poſſibility onely: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. <hi>But if ye ſhall ſtill do wickedly ye ſhall be conſumed both ye and your King:</hi> now none can conclude from thence that they muſt needs continue to do wickedly, or that there is not a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to abſtain from doing wickedly; but the hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis or ſuppoſition in that place doth onely declare that there was a poſſibility for them ſtill to do wickedly, or not to do ſo any more. Hence alſo the hypotheſis, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.36. doth only declare a poſſibility to ſinne, or not to ſinne againſt God, <hi>(if they ſinne againſt thee.)</hi> Now <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> words which are by him brought as the reaſon why he ſaid to God, <hi>if they ſinne againſt thee</hi> (which are thoſe in the parentheſis aforeſaid) are ſo tranſlated that they make the hypotheticall axiom <hi>(if they ſinne againſt thee)</hi> ridiculous and nonſenſe; becauſe if it be true, that there is no man that ſinneth not, then its ridiculous and nonſenſe to ſay to God, or any other, <hi>if they do ſin,</hi> when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged and declared that there is no man which ſinneth not: but it is moſt apt ſenſe to ſay, <hi>if they ſinne againſt thee, for there is no man which may not ſinne,</hi> or that is not in a poſſibility to ſin, by reaſon of the mans weakneſſe for a long time, and the manifold temptations he is liable unto.</p>
               <p>Hence the Tranſlators ought to have tranſlated the ſaid verſe (to make it good ſenſe) <hi>if they ſinne againſt thee, for
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29469:117"/>there is no man which may not ſinne;</hi> which is the Potential mood of the verb, and preſent tenſe of the ſame mood, which the Tranſlators ought to have rendred the verb In (to ſinne or tranſgreſſe) though it is true that the ſaid verb in the ſaid place (in the Hebrew text) is in the future tenſe: but who is there (that knows any thing of that language) who knows not that the Hebrews have no potential mood of a verb; and that when they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make uſe of the ſame mood to declare the ſenſe of Scripture, according as it is intended, they then ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the future tenſe of the Indicative mood in the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial mood, as aforeſaid? which the Engliſh Tranſlators ſhould have done, to have made the hypothetical axiom good ſenſe in reference to the reaſon given immediately in the Parentheſis, to illuſtrate the hypothetical axiom by.</p>
               <p>Again, its requiſite to find out the ſenſe and ſcope of a Scripture-axiom, to obſerve whether the ſaid axiom be laid down abſolutely, without any dependence on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text; or whether it be laid down with ſome relative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle (to be taken notice of) evidencing its dependence upon the context, antecedent or conſequent.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance; it is thus tranſlated, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. <hi>for there is no man which ſinneth not;</hi> hence it is more confidently affirmed, then truly by moſt, that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there is no man upon earth which doth good and ſinneth not.</p>
               <p>But the miſtake of theſe men (who affirm as aforeſaid) is from the miſtranſlating of the Hebrew particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which indeed is a relative particle, and doth intimate that this verſe doth relate unto the 19 verſe, which is the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent context thereunto; where it is ſaid, that <hi>wiſdome doth ſtrengthen the wiſe more then ten mighty men which are in the city:</hi> The meaning is, that wiſdome will fence and ſecure a wiſe man more from dangerous aſſaults and violence, then ten mighty men which are in the city. For the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, and to ſhew the excellency of wiſdome, and the uſe thereof in a ſuperlative degree, <hi>Solomon</hi> doth ſubjoyn the 20 verſe, ſo as to make it with the 19 verſe a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29469:117"/>diſcrete axiom, by putting a diſcrete particle (if rightly tranſlated) to the 20 verſe: but our Tranſlators expreſſe that particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by a a cauſal particle, <hi>for,</hi> which indeed being ſo expreſſed maketh thoſe ſaid 19, 20 verſes (relating together) to contain in their relative reſpect little or no ſenſe at all, as will appear to every truth-ſearching man, thus: <hi>Wiſedom doth ſtrengthen the wiſe man more then ton mighty men which are in the City, for</hi> (or <hi>becauſe</hi>) <hi>there is not a juſt man upon earth which doth good and ſinneth not.</hi> Now is that a good reaſon or cauſe why wiſedom doth ſtrengthen a wiſe man more then ten mighty men, even becauſe there is not a juſt man upon earth who doth good and ſinneth not? ſurely its not a better reaſon then his was who gave out of his ſhallow judgement that <hi>Tenderden</hi> ſteeple was the cauſe of <hi>Goodwin-Sandes,</hi> becauſe-<hi>Goodwin Sandes</hi> was after <hi>Tenderden</hi> ſteeple. That ſtory Biſhop <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> made uſe of upon an occaſion (in a Sermon before King <hi>Edward</hi>) concerning ſuch who ignorantly put <hi>non cauſam pro cauſa,</hi> that which is no cauſe for the cauſe.</p>
               <p>So do the Tranſlators by their tranſlation put <hi>non cauſam pro cauſa;</hi> for ſinne is no cauſe why wiſedome hath any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent effect, but the contrary rather, if we believe what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Dead flies make the ointment of the Apothecarie to ſmel; ſo doth a little folly him that is in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for wiſedom.</hi> But if the Tranſlators had tranſlated the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> diſcretely, <hi>though: although: notwithſtanding:</hi> and rendred the verb (which is in the future tenſe of the Indicative mood) in the preſent tenſe of the Potential mood then had they given a good and profitable ſenſe of the words thus; <hi>Wiſedom ſtrengtheneth a wiſe man more then ten mighty men which are in a City; although there be no man upon earth which doth good and ſinneth not:</hi> as it did ſtrengthen Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.20, 21. and <hi>Stephen</hi> alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.10.</p>
               <p>By tranſlating the ſaid words in the manner aforeſaid (as they ſhould have done) they had not been guilty of ſeducing the people to believe, by their tranſlation, that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth affirm (contrary to Scriptures) that there is no man upon earth which doth good and ſinneth not. If
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29469:118"/>thoſe (who are Judges, and aſſume power to ſcan and judge mens words) do conclude the axiom or axioms to be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and abſolutely affirmed or denyed, which are only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended relatively to the antecedent or conſequent axioms; we ſay, if they do ſo, <hi>quis pene innocens ſit?</hi> who can free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from treaſon or blaſphemy, as often as their tryers and Judges pleaſe to declare their words abſolutely and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly ſpoken, when the author of them intended them (as <hi>Solomon</hi> did in the place aforeſaid) onely to be relatively ſpoken? By which kind of dividing axioms he did more wickedly then wittily, who ſaid, <hi>Hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> concealing and not mentioning Chriſts antecedent words, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.40. <hi>On theſe commandements hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Que. Whether if we doubt of the meaning of an axiom which is a divine teſtimony, we are not to conſider (to the end we may ſee the meaning of it) the artificial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contained in the ſaid axiom: for though <hi>teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> be <hi>argumentum inartificiale,</hi> yet the axiom conſiſts of artificial arguments, and theſe <hi>teſtata</hi> muſt be proved by artificial arguments, or ſomething equivalent or <hi>tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> unto them; which are qualifications requiſite to be in every witneſſe, as <hi>ſcientia, virtus, prudentia:</hi> Firſt, Knowledge in the <hi>teſtis,</hi> elſe he will ſpeak he knoweth not what, like them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. Secondly, Vertue, or elſe talke they care not what, as they did, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.15. upon a ſad account. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Conſtancy, elſe the <hi>teſtes</hi> will ſeem to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they did that cryed before Chriſt, <hi>Hoſanna to the higheſt,</hi> and the next day cried, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore to find out the true meaning of the <hi>res teſtata,</hi> the thing affirmed or denied, we muſt ſee what arguments (relating one to another) are contained in the axiom which is a Scripture-teſtimony.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance; Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Nicodemus, Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> Now what water Chriſt meaneth is the thing to be inquired into. We inſtance in the ſaid place, becauſe there was a learned reſpondent who did of late in a publique diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29469:118"/>affirm (and the opponent did not deny it, though he might) that elementary baptiſmal water was meant by Chriſt in the ſaid place. His only reaſon was (without any further demonſtration) becauſe ſo many Fathers had for ſo many ages downward atteſted it (without any arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial arguments, but onely their bare words) to be ſo: which is the reaſon (we profeſſe to all men) why we doubt that ſenſe to be the meaning of water in that place, unleſſe the ſaid reſpondent can aſſure us that thoſe Fathers, (or ſome of them) were by inſpirement infallible in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the ſaid ſenſe; if he can, then we will believe their <hi>Ipſi dixerunt,</hi> without any artificial arguments to prove what they ſay; becauſe we then know what they affirm is true by reaſon they have (then) <hi>received the unction,</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.26.) which is truth, and is no lye: But in the mean time he muſt pardon us that we diſſent from him and his catalogue of Fathers (on which he buildeth his faith, for ought we ſee) in that point; and deſire him to give us leave, or rectifie our weakneſſe by ſome ſtronger reaſons then we heard from him at that time, to declare to him firſt negatively, that the words of Chriſt could ſignifie no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Our reaſon is from the artificial arguments contained in that axiom, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> The axiom is a compound axiom, (as all exceptive and excluſive axioms are,) wherein are two axioms, one affirmative, the other negative.</p>
               <p>Now as affirmation is before negation, ſo in the ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive compound axiom, the affirmative axiom is firſt to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a man is to be born again of water and of the Spirit, to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>In the firſt axiom is laid down the effect, <hi>to be born again,</hi> and its cauſes, <hi>water and the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond axiom is intimated the neceſſity of thoſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:29469:119"/>cauſes to the ſaid effect, that without thoſe two ſaid can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes none can be born again to the kingdom of God. And ſo much for the general conſideration of the two axioms. Our firſt reaſon (we ſay) why baptiſmal elementary wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not meant there, is, becauſe the effect and its cauſes are of the ſame nature or quality, according to the old and true maxime, <hi>Qualis effectus talis cauſa, &amp; contrà, Such as the effect is ſuch are the cauſes,</hi> by reaſon that <hi>Cauſa eſt cujus vi res eſt, A cauſe is by whoſe force and vertue a thing is.</hi> Hence the birth (ſpecified <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.) being (as none, we believe, will deny) ſpiritual, the cauſes muſt be ſpiritual alſo, which Chriſt nameth to be water and the Spirit in a copulate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the effect; alſo Chriſt putteth water as the firſt cauſe in order to the effect aforeſaid: hence we affirm both cauſes, water and the Spirit, concurr as partial requiſite cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the effect. Secondly, that both cauſes therefore muſt be ſpiritual becauſe the effect is ſpiritual: but baptiſmal elementary water is a groſſe, material, and no ſpiritual water; and therefore the ſaid water cannot be the water Chriſt meaneth as a partial concurrent cauſe to the new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual birth. If it be ſaid, that baptiſmal elementary wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is figurative, and repreſentative of the new birth: That will not ſerve the turn; becauſe Chriſt doth not ſpeak of a new birthin reſpect of a partial repreſentative cauſe, but he ſpeaks of water as the true and reall, partial, cowork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe out of which a man muſt be born again, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid elementary water is not meant.</p>
               <p>Neither can what is ſaid be evaded by affirming that inſtrumental cauſes may be of another nature to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal efficient cauſes; as the Apoſtles were, when it is ſaid by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. <hi>we are labourers together with God:</hi> for though that be true in ſome reſpect, when they are uſed as preparatory cauſes, or inſtruments to the preparing of the ſaid effect, yet it is not true that heterogeneal cauſes can communicate immediately their vertue in common to the ſaid effect, and yet the effect be wholly of the nature of one of them, and not of the other; as we ſay in this place, that the effect is wholly ſpiritual, and Chriſt nameth water the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29469:119"/>concurring cauſe in common with the Spirit, from which this ſpiritual effect doth proceed.</p>
               <p>Again, though <hi>Paul</hi> do call himſelf <hi>a fellow-labourer,</hi> as aforeſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. yet the ſame effect of which he was a preparatory inſtrument, and but a preparatory inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might have been produced without him; and no man, we think, dare affirm, that except <hi>Paul</hi> or his fellow-Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had concurred, that the Corinthians and others could not have been begotten again in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, Chriſt ſpecifieth the water in the ſaid place to be ſo neceſſary, that <hi>except a man be born of it and the Spirit he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the kingdome of God:</hi> which, if it be elementary baptiſmal water which is there meant, then no man nor child can be ſaved, or enter into the kingdome of God without it, no not <hi>Seth, Enoch,</hi> nor <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor any of the Patriarchs, unleſs they and every one of them were baptized with ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary water: but it is not likely, though the Jews had ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial waſhings, and though their waſhings were called baptiſm, that any of them uſed to baptize with water as Chriſt hath left the inſtitution &amp; direction of it to be, <hi>In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt</hi> (as is expreſſed <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.) which yet they muſt uſe in like manner, or none of them were or could be born again to the kingdome of God without it; becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter, &amp;c.</hi> Again, if it be ſuch water aforeſaid which Chriſt maketh ſo neceſſary, as aforeſaid, then thoſe do very ill who are of that opinion, if they do not urge all parents to baptize their children ſo ſoon as they peep into the world (eſpecially if they maintain the old tradition, of original ſinne) becauſe they are liable to ſudden death <hi>(Quod cuivis poteſt accidere cuiquam poteſt)</hi> and not deferre the baptizing their children unto ſome more convenient time (as many do) for a more pompous and magnificent adminiſtration thereof.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we do affirm with confidence, that the water Chriſt meant in the ſaid place is the divine and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual word, according to that, <hi>John</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now you are clean through the word I have ſpoken unto you,</hi> which is Chriſts
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29469:120"/>living and powerful word, which is called <hi>ſpirit and life, John</hi> 6.63. which alſo is aptly called <hi>water</hi> by Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath the ſame parallel effect to the defiled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regen erate ſoul, that water hath to the defiled body; for as water cleanſeth the defiled body, ſo the ſaid word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth clean the defiled ſoul, according to that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26, 27. where it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for his Church, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it by the waſhing of water, in</hi> or <hi>through the word,</hi> as the Greek expreſſeth it, making the word the exegeſis of the water; and the vulgar Latine turneth it, <hi>the word of life:</hi> hence Chriſt did ſay to <hi>Nicodemus, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again of water,</hi> that is, the word, called water as aforeſaid, <hi>he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this word is meant by the water aforeſaid, becauſe none can enter into the kingdome of God without a waſhing with that word called, alſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>the Laver of regeneration, &amp;c. for no unclean thing can enter,</hi> Rev. 21.27. and Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now you are clean through the word I have ſpoken to you:</hi> and <hi>James</hi> 1.18. it is ſaid, <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we preſume to adde yet a little further, to ſhew how needful it is to prove from the text, or context, that the ſenſe we fix upon a Scripture-axiom is the proper ſenſe which the Holy Ghoſt intendeth in the ſaid place; Becauſe one Mr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> of <hi>Fenny Drayton</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> hath ſet forth a book which he intitles <hi>A three fold defence of original ſinne</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the old common notion thereof; in which book he ſaith, (p. 94.) that the Examiners of the late Synods Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith deal ſophiſtically with him and his party in leaving out their chief argument, which lieth (hid we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to us) in 3 <hi>John</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>But if it do appear that we have ſophiſticated with them, we acknowledge that they may juſtly (according to their large power of admitting or hindring) <hi>interdicere nobis aquâ &amp; igne; ſed qui non eſt ſponte nocens</hi> we deſire him to pardon; for we do profeſs to him that we did not dream of ſuch a beſt in the ſaid place among all their weak arguments for their tradition of original ſinne, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:29469:120"/>
               <p>The ſenſe Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> ſixeth upon thoſe words (<hi>John</hi> 6.3. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi>) is, that original ſinne and the impurity of the natural birth is meant by the ſame words; and therefore there is a neceſſity of a new birth (ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 5.) from original ſinne. Which we grant if it be in all men; but that is <hi>petitio principii;</hi> its the thing to be proved, though yet there is a neceſſity of a new birth according to v. 5. and for the reaſon added v. 6. but we challenge Mr. <hi>Stevens,</hi> (who boaſteth of this place to contain (being as little to the purpoſe as the reſt) their chief argument) to prove (for as yet he hath not done it) that Chriſt meant by <hi>fleſh</hi> (from which that which is fleſh is born) is original ſinne and impurity by nature; which we openly deny (as it were at the market-croſſe.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>fleſh</hi> in Scripture is taken in more ſenſes then Mr. <hi>Steven</hi>'s his diſtinction of <hi>fleſh</hi> in the ſaid place (p. 94.) doth comprehend.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe <hi>fleſh</hi> is more largely taken in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture then he can yet fathom within his apprehenſion; and oppoſite alſo to the ſanctifying work of the Spirit: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſay Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> diſtinction and his explication of it doth not prove what he with raſh confidence affirmeth.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>fleſh</hi> is taken in Scripture in other reſpects then Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> mentioneth, as aforeſaid, theſe following Scriptures do evidence: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the fleſh; yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth we know him ſo no more.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> apply the ſaid place to his ſenſe of <hi>fleſh, John</hi> 3.6. and make good and Chriſtian-like ſenſe of the ſaid words if he can; for there is ſpoken of a <hi>knowing Chriſt no more after the fleſh, although they had known him ſo before:</hi> now to know them after the fleſh muſt intend not to own them after the fleſh any more, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> could not but know them after the humane fleſh by reaſon all are in that condition to be outwardly converſed with.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He did never know (that is, own) Chriſt at any time after the fleſh, as it is meant by Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond member of his diſtinction; for Chriſt was not born
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:29469:121"/>in original ſinne, nor yet lived at any time in the corruption of nature. Hence <hi>fleſh</hi> in this place doth not come under any member of Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> deſtinction. Again, <hi>fleſh</hi> in this place is the ſame in ſenſe, as appeareth by <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in reference to men, and the reaſon of the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning any man henceforth after the fleſh is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his diſowning Chriſt after the fleſh any more: for ſo the arguing lieth clear, by the emphatical expreſſion or revocation; <hi>yea though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth we know him ſo no more:</hi> therefore the <hi>fleſh</hi> is to be taken in that place in the ſame ſenſe as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth to men and Chriſt; and <hi>Paul</hi> would henceforth know neither men, nor Chriſt after the fleſh: hence its plain that the <hi>fleſh</hi> there was a ſtate in contradiſtinction to the Spirit, or his other ſanctifying work of the Spirit, in which <hi>Paul</hi> would not henceforth know them in. Again, in <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>fleſh</hi> is taken in another ſenſe then Mr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> doth apprehend.</p>
               <p>But to come nearer to the ſenſe of <hi>fleſh,</hi> as it may ſuit with <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>fleſh</hi> is taken <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. not for corruption of nature in any kind, (becauſe none can think the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ever did expect to be perfected by ſinneful nature, after they had begun in the Spirit; much leſſe did <hi>Paul</hi> drive at it, ſo as to upbraid them for attempting to be perfected by the <hi>fleſh</hi> in that ſenſe;) but for the <hi>fleſhly ordinances they were turning back unto after they had begun in the Spirit;</hi> as doth plainly appear in <hi>chap.</hi> 4.21, 22, &amp;c. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. the Ceremonial ſervices (in which the Sribes and Phariſees reſted in and were captived to, are called <hi>the carnal comman dement:</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11, 12. Hence the obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them were but carnal, becauſe the ordinances were but fleſhly. <hi>Hence that which is born of the fleſh is</hi> ſtill <hi>fleſh,</hi> according to Chriſts words, <hi>John</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>Now with Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> his favour, in this ſenſe of <hi>fleſh,</hi> and not in his, of original ſinne, and impurity of the birth, did Chriſt teach <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> firſt, the neceſſity of a new birth; Secondly, the neceſſity of it by the water and Spirit, which are the two copulate cauſes of it named by Chriſt; and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29469:121"/>that upon the reaſon Chriſt giveth, from the nature of the cauſe to the like nature of the effect, in two inſtances, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit:</hi> for it was in that fleſh, that is, in fleſhly ordinances that he and others were captived in, therefore not in Mr. <hi>Steven</hi>'s ſenſe of <hi>fleſh</hi> did Chriſt intend that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> becauſe Chriſt had no occaſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him from <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to fall upon the doctrine of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſinne; this appears from <hi>Nicodemus</hi> diſcourſe with him, owning him (upon his working ſuch works) <hi>to be a teacher come from God:</hi> our Saviour knowing <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was <hi>a maſter in Iſrael,</hi> v. 10. and likewiſe well knowing wherein all the preſent maſters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtuck, and what they gloried in, being puffed up (though cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived) with fleſhly ordinances (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.17, 18, &amp;c.) he taught <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a new leſſon, of the neceſſity of his and their new birth, from better principles then fleſhly rules and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, which onely ſerved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. <hi>but to the purifying of the fleſh, becauſe that which is born of the fieſh is fleſh</hi> ſtill, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their neceſſity of being born again appeareth from that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. where it is ſaid, <hi>they went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs</hi> (we hope none will ſay it was original ſinne and corruption) and <hi>neglected the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God:</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. Chriſt telleth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>that except their righteouſneſs exceeded the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, they ſhall not enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven;</hi> therefore it was neceſſary for them to be born again, and alſo all of their way and mind: hence Chriſt uſeth an indefinite pronoun, applicable to all ſuch men, <hi>Except any be born again, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe its not likely <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſhould be more ignorant of the doctrine of original ſinne then Mr. <hi>Stevens,</hi> if there were ſuch an univerſal continued pollution of it (as the world hath been made to believe, without any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-arguments, unleſs onely ſeeming arguments) by the pretended maſters and doctors of the Chriſtian <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is not likely (we ſay) that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſhould be ignorant, as aforeſaid, by reaſon he was <hi>a teacher and maſter in Iſrael,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:29469:122"/>v.</hi> 10. and <hi>John</hi> 7.50, 51, &amp;c. eſpecially, becauſe the Pſalmes of <hi>David</hi> were extant long before <hi>Nicodemus</hi> time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not be ignorant of the 51 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> from whence is the chief argument the Zelots for original ſinne have: but yet nothing convictive to any rational man, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the anſwers given to our interpretation of the 5. verſe; which alſo are not worth the replying unto, unleſs it be to ſatisfie weaker capacities, who believe every thing the Originaliſts ſay concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reaſon. Becauſe Chriſt knowing <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his good will unto him, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 7.50, 51. would never (upon <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> his wondring at the ſtrangneſs of Chriſts ſpeech) have omitted to explain himſelf to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the matter of original ſinne, and in ſuch a manner, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſhould have been convinced to ſay as they did, <hi>John</hi> 16.29. <hi>Now thou ſpeakeſt plainly,</hi> by reaſon it was Chriſts great buſineſs <hi>to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt, Matth.</hi> 18.11. but Chriſt ſpeaketh not a word of that, for <hi>Nicodemus</hi> goeth on ſtill, wondering <hi>how theſe things could be, v.</hi> 9. and Chriſt reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, <hi>v.</hi> 20. ſaying, <hi>Art thou a maſter in Iſrael, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not theſe things?</hi> and ſo our Saviour proceedeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to him what he knew and had ſeen, and admireth that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſhould be ſo ignorant not to underſtand earthly things, <hi>which are below the heavenly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.48, 49. and ſo Chriſt proceedeth to ſhew theſe maſters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the myſtery of the belief (beſides the neceſſity of it) in many particulars; and firſt, in that of <hi>Moſes lifting up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, v.</hi> 14. ſurely if the ſtate of original ſinne and natural impurity by birth had been <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> and others ſay it is all mens) his ſtate and condition, Chriſt would (no doubt) upon the account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid have taught <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (upon this occaſion of his coming to him) to bewaile and deplore firſt and moſtly his original birth in ſin; as that notorious murderer execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Cheapſide, An.</hi> 1657. was taught and preſſed in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions (as its printed, and its reported by whom it was) to bewaile his original ſinne and impure natural birth before and above all his debauched life, adulteries, and horrid
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:29469:122"/>murders for which he was executed: but Chriſt ſpeaketh not one plain word of any ſuch thing to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of his and others impure natural birth, therefore we cannot pin our belief upon Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> bare opinion of the ſenſe of the ſaid place.</p>
               <p>But we ſay again with more evidence then Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> can for all his confidence in his conceit, from the text and context, that Chriſt ſpake to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of the neceſſity of his (and all his fellow-doctors) being born again from their fleſhly ſtate, in and from the fleſhly ordinances of the Law, that they were puffed up with and reſted in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſ. Becauſe the ſaid rights and ſervices ſignifie <hi>fleſh,</hi> and are declared to be carnal, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſ. Becauſe they made nothing perſect; but <hi>the bringing in a better hope did,</hi> Heb. 7.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reaſ. Becauſe to treat of this ſtate and new birth from them was more pertinent to the occaſional diſcourſe of Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> then any thing that Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> hath ſaid or can ſay to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Hence we declare to the impartial Reader, that Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> hath wronged us, and born falſe witneſs againſt us, (peradventure it is for want of reading the ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements to his people, that he forgot the ninth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement) in ſaying, before he had proved it, we have ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dealt with him and his party in leaving out their chief argument for orignal ſinne from <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6. for they have no colour but a fading fleſhly colour for what they ſay, <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6. Now for his abuſe of us in this particular we ask no more ſatisfaction from him at preſent, but that he will be pleaſed to declare that he is more then confident we can anſwer his weaker arguments, and alſo that we can make more then ſufficient replies to his weak anſwers to our arguments againſt original ſinne; becauſe we have worſted him (we appeal to the impartial ſtander by) in his ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt argument (as he raſhly calleth it) for original ſin out of the place aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Therefore (upon the account aforeſaid) we hope he will make it known, that we may ſpare our needleſs paines
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:29469:123"/>to make further reply unto that part of his weak defence of original ſinne, which concerneth the Examiners to take notice of; and as for that part of the ſaid book which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> we doubt not but he will let Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> know in due time, <hi>qui vir ſiet</hi> againſt his defence for original ſinne.</p>
               <p>We muſt yet take a little further liberty to declare the neceſſity of looking upon what grounds we fix our ſenſe upon any Scripture-axiom in any particular place of Scripture, becauſe there is a grave Doctor, and ſome others in <hi>Wilts,</hi> who fix this ſenſe on Chriſts words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.21. namely, that Chriſt adviſeth the rich man <hi>to go ſell all his temporal poſſeſſions and give them to the poor:</hi> this is their ſenſe, and the ſenſe of many more without demonſtrative argument from text or context; and therefore we deny to take their words for it without reaſons given with them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe we can find no command in general through out the Scripture to command <hi>a rich man to ſell all his temporal eſtate and give it to the poor:</hi> if there be, let theſe abounders in their own ſenſe ſhew it us; for if there ſhould be any ſuch place of Scripture, it would croſs other Scriptures; as firſt that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. where it is ſaid, <hi>he that provides not for his family is worſe then an infidel;</hi> and this man for ought we know might have a family.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it would croſs that Scripture where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>that one ſhould not be eaſed, and another burdened, but that there ſhould be equality,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. Now if the young man had then gone and ſold all he had (as Chriſt did bid him) and given it to the poor, he had indeed eaſed them, but burdened himſelf, in leaving himſelf nothing of his vaſt eſtate; for it is ſaid, <hi>he had great poſſeſſions;</hi> and ſo he had made himſelf a burden to others.</p>
               <p>Again, it is not certain there were ſo many poor at that time among the Jews; and they medled with the Gentiles in that caſe (its probable) no more then the Samaritans did with the Jewes in divers caſes, <hi>John</hi> 4.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt doth not bid him ſell it and have it in common, to communicate it, as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:29469:123"/>with others; if it had been ſo there might have been ſome argument from it to incline him to obey Chrſts adviſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then he might have had as good ſhare (being before his own) as others had in like need: but Chriſt bids him go and ſell all he had, and ſo fulfil the Proverb, make himſelf <hi>as poor as Job,</hi> without giving him any comfort in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his eſtate, by telling him that he might have part of it himſelf with the poor; but, <hi>go ſell all and give to the poor,</hi> ſaith Chriſt unto him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Paul</hi> telleth <hi>Ananias, Acts</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. that his eſtate was his own, and that he was left free to do as he pleaſed, he was not bound by any requiring to ſell all his eſtate, and bring it to be diſtributed; but <hi>Peter</hi> reproveth him for his hypocritical diſſimulation onely in keeping back part of his eſtate under hand, contrary to his outward pretence hence: <hi>à pari,</hi> it is not likely or probable from what Chriſt ſaid to him, that Chriſt required him to go and ſell all his temporal eſtate and give it to the poor: for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> is not by <hi>Peter</hi> told that he was required to ſell all that he had and to give it to the poor; but <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to him, <hi>whiles it remained was it not thine own? and after when it was ſold, was it not in thy own power? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Reaſ. Becauſe Chriſt telleth him that he ſhould be perfect <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> (upon the ſuppoſition of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going univerſal obedience which he profeſſed he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>If Iſhould give my body to be burned, and my goode to the poor, I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit my felf nothing if I have not love:</hi> therefore Chriſt could not intend to bid the man ſell his temporal eſtate that <hi>ipſo facto</hi> he might be perfect, becauſe that fact in it ſelf would not have made him perfect, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> reſtimony aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Reaſ. Becauſe Chriſt had no occaſion given him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of temporal eſtates; therefore Chriſt did not bid him fell all his temporal eſtate and riches, but his own falſe ſpiritual riches, which was his high conceit of himſelf; for after Chriſt had declared the happy eſtate of Children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13, 14. then cometh this Querent (St. <hi>Luk</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:29469:124"/>ſtyleth him a ruler <hi>cap.</hi> 18.18.) to know what he muſt do, and telleth Chriſt what he had done in order to Chriſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. and would know what he had more to do; Chriſt telleth him, <hi>to ſell all that he had and give it to the poor;</hi> the words are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſell all thy own which remaineth, or ſell all things remaining that are thine: now the ſelf-choſen righteouſneſſe, and ſuch like ſtuffe are the mans own, <hi>for the earth is the Lords and the fulneſſe thereof,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.26. therefore that is not the mans, but Gods, that he may command when he pleaſeth, &amp; may be no impediment to eternal life unto them that do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a great meaſure of it. Hence you ſee the occaſion given to Chriſt from the Querie of the man, and his reply, from whence (no doubt) our Saviour took opportunity to give him the adviſe aforeſaid. Read alſo the other Evangeliſts, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.17. to <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.18, 19, 20, to 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 25, 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.34, 35. and it may eaſily be perceived how apt theſe ſort of men are to juſtifie themſelvs, when that which is high in men is oft abomination to God: ſo we may ſee how <hi>Laodicea</hi> was lifted up with this ſort of ſpiritual falſe riches, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.10. as is apparent by the Lords counſell to that Church what to do in that caſe. And <hi>Paul</hi> upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Corinthians, that they were rich, and ful, and wanted nothing, and reigned as Kings,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9. yet not in truth, as thoſe Kings ſpoken of, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.11. but onely in their own high conceivings, becauſe the ſaid Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was not ſo rich in temporals at that time. Secondly, it appeareth that they looked on themſelves as rich in high conceivings, by <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſions in reference to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. Thirdly, becauſe he wiſheth <hi>they did reign, that the Apoſtles might reign with them.</hi> Hence, it is eaſie, by comparing the foreſaid teſtimonies with the words and deportment of this man, to underſtand that it was ſpiritual falſe riches of ſelfe-choſen righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that were his great poſſeſſions which our Saviour biddeth him to ſell and part with, that he might be perfect and complete (having done what he ſaid) and ſo by his righteouſneſſe which Chriſt would have him, ſhew forth, he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:29469:124"/>might have treaſure in Heaven; for <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.4. it ſaid, <hi>By humility, and the fear of the Lord are riches, and honour, and life:</hi> and <hi>Math.</hi> 18.4. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoever ſhall humble himſelfe as a little child, the ſame is great in the kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſumm up all in this Syllogiſticall demonſtration:</p>
               <p>Thoſe riches which Chriſt had onely an occaſion to take notice of to be the mans poſſeſſions, the ſame in reaſon we ought to believe Chriſt did intend when he bid the man <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll all he had</hi> &amp;c. But they were his ſpiritual falſe riches of his choſen holineſſe andhigh-conceitedneſſe that Chriſt had occaſion given him from the man, and others of his like mind, to take notice of. Therefore thoſe riches were the riches which he counſels him to ſell. The major cannot be denied; and we hope the Aſſumption is proved by former inſtances.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, it was his temporal eſtate, becauſe <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went away ſorrowful:</hi> We anſwer, that it will not follow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily thereupon: becauſe thoſe who are rich in falſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wiſedom and holineſs, (<hi>Luk</hi> 18.11.) are as unwilling, yea more, to part with their poſſeſſions, as theformer; and therefore our Saviour telleth them, <hi>that Publicans and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers ſhould enter into Heaven before them,</hi> Mat. 21.31. And the reaſon is, becauſe it is eaſier to convince the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Harlots (having no excuſe) then to convince theſe, as appeareth <hi>Job.</hi> 9.34, 40. and 7.48, 49.</p>
               <p>If it be yet further urged, that Chriſt meant as aforeſaid, becauſe he bid him give them to the poor: We anſwer, though Chriſt did bid him do ſo, yet its <hi>Ignoratio elenchi</hi> to conclude thence that Chriſt meant the mans temporall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, becauſe there are other poor beſides theſe poor; as Chriſt telleth the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that ſhe was poor: therefore none can affirm that Chriſt meant only the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poor, becauſe, Where there are many ſpecials under a general that is only named, we muſt give ſome undenyable reaſon why that ſpecial we nominate is meant rather then another ſpeciall by reaſon all the ſpecials are not alike, but differ ſpecifically, and by their next forms,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29469:125"/>from each other, even as a man and a brute do, and yet are both animals, living ſenſible creatures, but yet not both rational creatures: ſo do many poor in temporals, and falſe righteouſneſſe, differ ſpecifically; and this laſt ſort of poors is meant by Chriſt, who could not boaſt of their righteouſneſſe, and did not boaſt of it, as this ſort of people did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. and theſe are the poor devils who are pooreſt of all in this kind, becauſe they have not ſo much as that choſen falſe righteouſneſſe to boaſt of as this ruler had (as he is called <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.18.) and as <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> did boaſt of, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17. who yet was truely poor in the midſt of her riches; therefore Chriſt bids him ſell them, (in that they kept him from being perfect to the kingdom of Heaven) and give them to thoſe poor devils, for then they might boaſt as well as himſelf, and be rich like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If this ſeemeth ſtrange arguing to any, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the Apoſtle (<hi>James.</hi> 2.29.) doth argue the <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidians,</hi> who boaſt of their vain faith without works, even by a parallel of faith in the devils; <hi>thou beleeveſt there is one God, thou doſt well; the devils believe and tremble.</hi> Hence upon the ſame account, may we think Chriſt argued the mans neceſſity to ſell all in reference to the poor devils, and give them to thoſe, becauſe they would do good to no man, but hinder him of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe riches are for ſome poor which ſtand in ſome relative reſpect to them, therefore Chriſt bids him give them to the poor devils. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. if he parted with theſe becauſe they were acquired from the devils perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and deluſion, and therefore to give them to the devils, who were the inſtigators to him to ſeek them and boaſt in them, was moſt proper counſell from our Saviour to him.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid further, Chriſt bids him <hi>ſell them and give them:</hi> therefore it was his temporal riches, becauſe the other cannot properly be ſold.

                  </gap> is the ſame expreſſed in both places to be parted with.</p>
               <p>But its urged yet further, that the diſciples did ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our Saviour by his general ſpeech, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. to Chriſt, we have forſaken all and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, and <hi>ver.</hi> 29. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every one that hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken houſes, brethren, lands, for my ſake, ſhall receive a hundred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and ſhall inherit eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If theſe words of Chriſt were intended literally of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29469:126"/>and Lands a hundred-fold to be received for what they forſook, it is not to be queſtioned, but many who have got houſes and Lands (how unduely ſoever got and poſſeſſed) but they would forſake them all upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended account, and let them take them whoſe they were, if they might have a hundred-fold more for them they left, &amp; Heaven to boot at laſt when they can enjoy theſe no longer. Therefore ſurely our Saviour did not intend his reply to <hi>Peter</hi> literally.</p>
               <p>Again, Chriſt doth not begin with that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting ſpeech to <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had told Chriſt what they had done, but ſaith to him, firſt, <hi>you that have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in the regeneration you ſhall (in due time) ſit upon twelve thrones;</hi> intimating plainly that it was for their following Chriſt in the regeneration, not for their forſaking all they had, which was not much, (<hi>Math.</hi> 4.19.) of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals) to follow him, that Chriſt ſpake ſuch good words and comfortable unto them: yet then he addeth further, that in caſe any do forſake freely of themſelves all they have, (but Chriſt adviſeth the man to ſell all he had) for his names ſake, to honour and ſerve him, they ſhall have ſuch a multiplied reward as is after ſpecified, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. yea with perſecutions, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.30. But let it be granted that <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt thought that Chriſt bid him ſell all his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral eſtate and give it to the poor, who had need; yet it doth not therefore follow that Chriſt meant his words in that ſenſe becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt thought ſo; for the Diſciples themſelves (as well as others, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19.) mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook in their nonage their Maſters ſenſe and meaning of his words, as appeareth by their miſtake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.23. Hence it is no argument for our cenſurers to build upon, that they miſtake not alſo Chriſts ſenſe and meaning, by concluding it to be his temporal eſtate, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles at that time did think ſo: but as the Apoſtles did miſtake their Maſter ſometimes, ſo do they our Saviours meaning in the ſaid place.</p>
               <p>We ſhall preſume to trouble their patience a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by adding the interpretation of two other Scriptures,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:29469:126"/>namely <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. which are much abuſed and prophaned too frequently, and of late by Mr. <hi>Ditton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Phelps,</hi> Grandees in the Committee of <hi>Wilts</hi> for ejection, &amp;c. and have been fierce men againſt us for that purpoſe, in a letter to a perſon of Honour, and of better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principles then themſelves: for in the ſaid letter they declare that the true Church of God doth account <q>all her righteouſneſſe to be as filthy rags, and do ſpecifie <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6.</q> for their warrant: but with their good Worſhips favour we confidently deny it, yet not without reaſons, but firſt from the relative reſpect wherein the 6 <hi>ver.</hi> ſtandeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 5. <hi>ver.</hi> which ſaid two verſes are diſpoſed together in a compound diſcrete axiom thus; <hi>Thou meeteſt him who rejoyceth and worketh righteouſneſſe, thoſe that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth, for we have ſinned, in thoſe is continuance, and we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſſe is as filthy rags, and we do fade like a leaf, our iniquities like the wind have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us away,</hi> ver. 6. Here we may evidently perceive the righteouſneſſe in the 5 <hi>ver.</hi> is ſet in a diſſentany reſpect with the righteouſneſſe in the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> and is ſo to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the particle <hi>(but)</hi> in the 5 <hi>ver.</hi> as both of them are to be conſidered and judged together in the form of a diſcrete axiom, of which that particle <hi>But</hi> is the ſigne.</p>
               <p>Now in a diſcrete axiom the parts are diſſentanies or diſagreers.</p>
               <p>Hence the righteouſneſſe in the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> is not the ſame with that in the 5. <hi>ver.</hi> becauſe diſagreers are not theſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in a diſcrete axiom the diſagreeing parts (which are here diſagreeing adjuncts to their ſubject) do but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree in ſome Logical or accidental reſpect unto their ſubjects: which argueth that (though their natures <hi>in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracto</hi> are oppoſites) yet they do but ſo diſagree in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to each others ſubject, as they can likewiſe agree to be (upon occaſion) in eithers ſubjects.</p>
               <p>For inſtance; they which had the righteouſneſſe as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rags, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. might have had that righteouſneſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. which God (who rejoyceth not in filthineſſe) <q>doth rejoyce
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:29469:127"/>in, and meeteth them who work it, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</q> yet ſtill thoſe two righteouſneſſes are not the ſame in thoſe two ſaid ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe they are diſpoſed in a diſcrete axiom, which doth comprehend diſagreeing parts; otherwiſe the axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om in a diſcrete form is ridiculous: as for inſtance, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality and riſibility are agreeing reſpects or arguments to man, becauſe he is a riſible as well as rational, though not by the ſame way, or from the ſame principle.</p>
               <p>Now to diſpoſe them in a compound diſcrete axiom, ſaying, a man is a rational, but a riſible creature, it were but ridiculous to wiſe men to ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>Hence we conclude that the righteouſneſſe in the 5. <hi>ver.</hi> is not the ſame with that in the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> becauſe they are diſcretely or diverſly diſpoſed in a diſcrete axiom as aforeſaid. And therefore it cannot be that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es beſt righteouſneſſe is as filthy rags.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it cannot be ſo, becauſe it is ſaid <q>God meeteth them who work that righteouſneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</q> for <hi>God loveth not wickedneſs, neither can evil dwell with him,</hi> Pſal. 4.4.</p>
               <p>But we ſhall preſume to mind them of divers Scriptures which will demonſtrate the ſaid opinion of the true Churches beſt righteouſneſſe to be moſt impious.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27, 28. that <hi>Chriſt ſanctifieth and cleanſeth his Church with the waſhing of water by the word, that it may be without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, holy and without blemiſh;</hi> and is the righteouſneſs of this Church as filthy rags?</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>That it ſhall come to paſs, that he who is left in Sion, and he that remaineth in Ieruſalem, ſhall be called holy;</hi> and when? namely (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) <hi>When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the daughter of Sion, &amp;c. by the ſpirit of judgment, and ſpirit of burning:</hi> and what will the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of theſe holy ones be ſtill as filthy rags?</p>
               <p>It is ſaid 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. of the true Church, that they are <q>changed into the image of Chriſt, from glory to glory as by the Spirit; and is their beſt righteouſneſs as filthy rags?</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is Chriſts teſtimony to his Church (his Spouſe) <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.8, 10, 11. and 4.1. <hi>Thou art all fair my love, there is no ſpot in thee</hi> (Chriſt doth not ſay <hi>in himſelf, but in thee,</hi>)
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:29469:127"/>and is her righteouſneſs yet as filthy rags? what cannot the Lord diſcern? or is he ſo partial that he will not ſee it, or ſay it is ſo (if it be as filthy rags) but ſay to his Church or Spouſe, <hi>thou art all fair, there is no ſpot nor wrinkle in thee?</hi> Can. 4.4.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. of thoſe that <q>they were waſhed ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, &amp; by the Spirit of my God? and was all their righteouſneſs but as filthy rags?</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <q>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. The fine linnen with which the Saints are clothed is the righteouſneſs of the Saints;</q> and is that fine linnen filthy rags? ſee what is ſaid, <q>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. And what is the new man created after God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</q> which the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were exhorted to put on <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. was it but as filthy rags?</p>
               <p>If the late Doctor <hi>Drayton</hi> had ſpoken as blaſphemous doctrines as his Judges and Examiners have done, he had been deſervedly accounted ignorant and inſufficient for the work of the Miniſtry: but <hi>ſic fata volunt,</hi> that the ignorant ofttimes ſit in the chair, and the intelligent ſtand at Barre.</p>
               <p>But they ſay further that our great Apoſtle did 'count all his own righteouſneſs as loſs and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. He did indeed account all his Phariſaical righteouſneſs (in which he had boaſted himſelf with a Phariſaical devotion and zeal) but loſs and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3.45. which he calleth 'the righteouſneſs of the law without the faith of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. but did he acknowledge the righteouſneſs he had attained unto by an operative faith (which giveth victory over the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4.) as filthy rags? What was the righteouſneſs to which the crown was promiſed him, and all who loved the appearing of Chriſt? was that righteouſneſs (we ask again) but loſs and dung? <hi>Paul</hi> fought a good fight indeed! he finiſhed a fair courſe in ſuch a righteouſneſs, and he kept a fruitful faith indeed which brought him to no more righteouſneſs but that which is but dung and loſs! O, but it is ſaid he called it ſo in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Chriſts righteouſneſs, or that which he had by faith in Chriſt. It is true, he ſaith that 'he deſires to be found in Chriſt, <hi>not having his own righteouſneſs which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, even the righteouſneſs of God by faith,</hi> v. 9.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:29469:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Its worth obſerving what expreſſions <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth in that verſe, for he doth not hence, nor <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all righteouſneſs of the law, but onely the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the law excluſively conſidered without the faith of Chriſt; but not that righteouſneſs of the law which is through the faith of Chriſt: and therefore he ſaith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greek reading, <q>
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9 10. that I may be found not having my 'own righteouſneſs of the law; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, 'but that righteouſneſſe which is through the faith of Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whence he ſheweth evidently that he received the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the law, which was that he attained not unto when he was a Phariſee, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. through the faith of Chriſt, for the law is the rule of all righteouſneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth all righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it muſt be attained through faith in Chriſt, becauſe that faith deduceth it from Chriſt, and maketh it to be what it is, 'even the righteouſneſs of or from God by faith, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>The Tranſlators by their tranſlation turn the words, as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſet the righteouſneſs out of the law in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to another righteouſneſs to be attained unto through the faith of Chriſt; when as its the ſame righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for nature with that <hi>Paul</hi> had before, but it was now qualified &amp; altered through the faith of Chriſt; <hi>Pauls</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs out of the law was not ſo qualified, before he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Lord Jeſus, according to his requiring, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1.</p>
               <p>Hence we ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> did not account his beſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs loſs and dung, nor yet his righteouſneſs out of the law loſs and dung through the faith of Jeſus abſolutely in it ſelf, but as it was unqualified with his faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And ſurely he did not adviſe <hi>Timothy</hi> to follow after the righteouſneſs which is loſs and dung, when he biddeth him 'follow after righteouſneſs &amp; holineſs, patience, meekneſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11, 12.</p>
               <p>They call St. <hi>Paul</hi> in their letters our great Apoſtle; but very inconſiderately, if his beſt righteouſneſs he had was but loſs and dung, for then he was not very great in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, to attain to no other righteouſneſs but that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:29469:128"/>which is but loſs and dung: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth but a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to ſet out the difference of his righteouſneſs of the law; but compariſons do not determine things in their abſolute nature, but in their comparate affection, <hi>as wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is better then rubies, Prov.</hi> 8.11. There is a compariſon of better &amp; worſe, yet it will not follow that rubies are worth nothing at all; yet are they worth nothing in compariſon of wiſdome, when they come in competition, and one of them is to be removed, then rubies are to be caſt away ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then wiſdome, becauſe wiſdome is better then rubies.</p>
               <p>There are many compariſons in Scripture of things and perſons compared, which are neither of them in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive degree ſuch as they ſeem to import in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative degree; as <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14. it is ſaid, <hi>the Publican went away rather juſtified then the Phariſee:</hi> and yet it will not follow that either of them (for the preſent) were juſtified, that is, made righteous. See in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.51, 52, &amp;c. It is ſaid of <hi>Judah, thou haſt juſtified thy Siſters Sodon and Gomorrah, they are more righteous then thou, &amp;c.</hi> yet none will ſay, if they conſider <hi>v</hi> 49. that Sodom was righteous. Therefore its needful to ponder what is declared by comparate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leſt we judge of things amiſs, by putting our ſenſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things from the comparative affection between them, which we miſtake often, and ſo put our conceited ſenſe to be that wherein things are compared, when indeed they are not ſo to be compared, without perverting the ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt. As once an highly eſteemed preacher did pervert the ſenſe of the Text, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>you hath he quickned who are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes;</hi> from whence he gathered this Doctrine (never intended by that text) that an unregenerate man can no more ſtirre, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing to prepare his converſion, then a logge or a ſtone, or a dead body can move; and he gave for his <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this reaſon, becauſe he is compared to a dead man; to which indeed he is compared in reſpect of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life, which is no more in him then life in a dead carcaſs; but yet the ſaid unregenerate living man is not dead in his natural life alſo, which yet quickneth and acteth all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:29469:129"/>and faculties, whereby he may hear, read, and pray to God to make what he heareth and readeth powerful and effectual to the ends and purpoſes appointed, that ſo faith 'at laſt may come by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and through prayer for ſtrength to avoid temptations he may through watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs abſtain 'from fleſhly luſts which war againſt the ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>Thus it is eaſie to abuſe compariſons to the bearing of falſe teſtimony againſt the mind of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>And that they may juſtifie their not daring to own any inherent righteouſneſſe (<hi>but ſuch as is as filthy rags</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) in themſelves, they produce for their warrant <hi>Pauls</hi> teſtimony of the <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.10. ſaying to them, 'you are complete in him, that is, as they dream, without inherent righteouſneſſe, but that which is aforeſaid; though <hi>Paul</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them how its to be complete in Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. even by being circumciſed with Chriſts circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſinns of the fleſh: not keeping it ſtill to 'humble them with a voluntary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. but that they might be eaſed of ſo great a burden, and ſo complete in Chriſt, being partakers of ſo

               <p>But we wiſh them to go (but not too late) with the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.25. and buy ſome of the ſalve Chriſt mentions, and anoint their eies, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.18. that they may ſee whether they had no inherent righteouſneſſe, in whom Chriſt was formed again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had no inherent righteouſneſſe who were chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the image of Chriſt from glory to glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. whether <hi>Peter</hi> did not think they had inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe who were partakers of the divine nature, or that the ſaid divine nature in them was as filthy rags as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>

Our reaſons of this Querie are theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it will then follow that if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his integrity (as he might have done) untill he had had a child of thirty years of age, which might have lived a moſt holy life as <hi>Enoch</hi> did on earth, yet upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall or tranſgreſſion afterward, his ſaid child or children muſt have loſt all, and been inwardly defiled with <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, and under the condemnation for it, though untill that very time they had lived moſt innocently in perſonal obedience to all Gods lawes; for many ſay (without book) becauſe God did (as they ſay) ſo covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> that what he loſt by tranſgreſſion he and his poſterity ſhould loſe <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> the ſame, and his poſterity be as truly defiled with his ſinne as himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe if it be ſo as aforeſaid, then in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood and perſevered in obedience to his lives end, as he might have done, (for it is ſaid, <hi>James</hi> 1.13, 14. God tempts no man to ſin, but that every man is drawn aſide of his own concupiſcence,) then though his poſterity
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29469:132"/>yea hitherto had broken Gods righteous laws, yet the juſt God muſt not have been angry with them, nor puniſhed them as ſinners, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf did not ſinne, in whom the Lord (as they ſay) made ſuch a covenant as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; and therefore what he received and did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit by his own tranſgreſſion, they muſt likewiſe receive, and muſt not loſe (by vertue of the ſaid covenant with <hi>Adam</hi>) notwithſtanding their perſonal frequent rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſobedience.</p>

               <p>The reaſon of this Querie is, becauſe the latter ſort of diſtempered ones are looked upon as irreligious men (as indeed they are) and are ſhamed and ſpoken againſt for ſuch diſtempers by the former ſort of diſtempered men, who are yet more frequently diſtempered (and longer) with malice, wrath, irreconcileableneſſe, and envy, then the others are with wine.

               <p n="27">27. Qu. What is the meaning of that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. 'And lo I am with you to the end of the world. The reaſon of this Querie is, becauſe that is the divine record from which a ſucceſſion of miniſtration is proved to continue downward from the Apoſtles to the end of the world; from whence the miniſters of the word and Sacrament do claim their own office to be <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and that they are the Apoſtles ſucceſſors deſcended lineally from them by vertue of Chriſts words and promiſe to the Apoſtles, <q>Lo I am with you to the end of the word.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But how they will prove what they ſay from the ſaid words of Chriſt by rational arguments, is the thing for the preſent we doubt of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the words are ſpoken not to the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, 'Lo I will be with you to the end of the world; but it is perſonally ſpoken to the Apoſtles, 'Lo I am with you to the end of the world. But to this it is ſaid, that Chriſt did intend their ſucceſſors to be included under
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:29469:136"/>thoſe words, becauſe the words are not literally true of the Apoſtles, by reaſon they are fallen aſleep with their Apoſtolical doctrine, and are no more perſonally in this world; therefore the words muſt include (ſay they) their ſucceſſors, 'I am with you, namely, my Apoſtles in your ſucceſſors, to the end of the world. But this is an addition to Chriſts words, for Chriſt ſaith no more, but, <q>Lo I am with you to the end of the world:</q> and by what authority they make that addition aforeſaid, it concerneth them to conſider, becauſe the curſe is heavy whic his charged on them who adde or take from Chriſts words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. But if they ſay Chriſt did intend to continue ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles for the good of his Church, to put them in remembrance, and teach them how to walk in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God without offence: we then ask (if it be ſo) whether Chriſt hath appointed themſelves to be the true ſucceſſors unto the Apoſtles by vertue of the ſaid words; for to argue meerly from the ſaid words, there muſt be ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, for divers good ends; <hi>ergo</hi> we miniſters aforeſaid, and them of our mind, order, and practiſe, are the men; is no better arguing to perſwade the doubtful of what they ſay, then he that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf that his ſonne muſt be the next Biſhop of <hi>C.</hi> becauſe it is appointed by order and authority, beſides cuſtome, that he muſt be a <hi>Cambridge</hi>-man or an <hi>Oxford</hi>-man; and if an <hi>Oxford</hi>-man, then of this Colledge, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colledge; if of this Colledge, then why not my ſon as well as another? eſpecially ſince I perſwade my ſelf he is the man intended for the Biſhop. Juſt ſo is the former argument; Chriſt did intend to have ſucceſſors in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles miniſtration, becauſe he ſaid, 'Lo I am with you (though the Greek text will not juſtifie that tranſlation) to the end of the world; and therefore we are the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who are their ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>Truly the Pope and Popelings argue juſt ſo for him to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor; <hi>Peter,</hi> ſay they, was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and governed there, and <hi>Peter</hi> was the prime and chief Apoſtle; for Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> 'Feed my lambs, feed my ſheep,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:29469:137"/>
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15. and thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> upon this rock I will build my Church, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.18. Now the <hi>Pope</hi> is a Miniſter alſo, if you will take his word for it, of Jeſus Chriſt, by vertue of the words of Chriſt aforeſaid; and he ſits and rules at <hi>Rome</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> governed Chriſts Church (as they ſay) therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, and head of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world upon the foreſaid account.</p>
               <p>Do not the Proteſtant Miniſters ſmile at ſuch argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for the Popes ſupremacy? and do the Miniſters who are in contradiſtinction to the <hi>Pope</hi> argue any better for their ſucceſſion and authority, to be the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, &amp; their Miniſters &amp; Biſhops to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> becauſe Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, 'Lo I am with you to the end of the world? for ſuppoſe that Chriſt had ſaid in plain terms, 'Lo I will be with you &amp; your ſucceſſors to the end of the world, will it be rational to ſay, <hi>quia antecedens, ideo hoc conſequens,</hi> therefore we are ſpecifically the ſaid ſucceſſors? muſt there not be ſomething elſe looked into, and to be proved, before they conclude, <hi>ergo</hi> we are ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, by reaſon Chriſt ſaid, 'Lo I am with you and your ſucceſſors to the end of the world? What are there no more maides then <hi>Maukin?</hi> may there not be another ſort of ſucceſſors beſides theſe claimers unto it? which if there may be, then its but like the arguing of the man aforeſaid for his ſonne to be the Biſhop of <hi>C.</hi> Surely <hi>Haman</hi> had a little better ground of argumentation for his perſwading himſelf that he was only the man (from former received and peculiar favours fom the King, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 3.1, 2. &amp; 5.11.) <q>that the King would delight ſtill to honour him above all others, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 7. and therefore upon ſurmiſe <hi>v.</hi> 7. he ſaith to the King, (upon the Kings asking what ſhould be done to the man the King delighted to honour, <hi>v.</hi> 6.) Let the royal apparel be brought forth which the King uſeth to wear, and the horſe the King rideth upon, and the crown royall which is upon his head, and let this apparell and the horſe be delivered to one of the Kings moſt noble Princes, that they may array the man whom the King delighteth to honour, and bring him on horſeback through the ſtreets
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:29469:137"/>of the City, &amp; proclaim before him, 'thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour;</q> &amp; what was <hi>Haman</hi> therefore the man? truly he thought he ſhould be the man upon the ſaid ſame antecedent probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for it: but yet he was deceived, for it was another whom <hi>Haman</hi> never dreamed of. Hence we ſay, is it good arguing that the Apoſtles muſt have ſucceſſors by vertue of Chriſts ſpeech, (which we have not yet well conſidered of) <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20.) therefore we are their ſucceſſors, and ſo Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt who can there be none but <hi>Haman</hi> (which notes troubling,) that the King doth delight to honour? is there not a <hi>Mordecai</hi> (the hidden contrite teacher) that he at laſt may have the honour conferred upon him, that <hi>Haman</hi> was more then confident was intended for him? Therefore he who argues from the general to the ſpecial, as belonging to it, muſt argue from the general to the ſpecial, <hi>ſecundum id generis quod eſt in ſpecie,</hi> according to that of the generall that is in the ſpeciall; which is to be applied thus to our purpoſe: The Miniſters aforeſaid do claim their miniſtration from the Apoſtles, becauſe they doubt not (though the words they bring will not remove their doubt) but the Apoſtles were to have ſucceſſors; and if ſucceſſors, then they themſelves are the ſucceſſors; but how do they prove it? for none can argue themſelves ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, but <hi>ſecundumid generis,</hi> that of the general requiſite to be in them that was in their predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtles, to whom Chriſt ſpake the words, had with their office ſuitable gifts thereunto, conferred upon them, to teach the people inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>libly to obſerve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt commanded them. Hence we aske the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid claim-layers to be the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, how they can lay claim (on their gloſſe aforeſaid upon the words of Chriſt); whether they lay claim to the office of the Apoſtles, for teaching, and other ſervices of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, without the like gifts; or with the like gifts. Now if to the office without the like gifts, then they do not lay their claim (with their favours) rationally, from our reaſon given before, how we muſt argue from the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:29469:138"/>general to the ſpecial, but according to that of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral which is in the ſpecial: therefore if they have not the like gifts in teaching, which is to teach infallibly by inſpiration from Jeſus Chriſt, even as witneſſes are taught, when called to make oath in point of teſtimony, to ſpeak the truth, and the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, ſo help us God; We ſay, if they have not the like gifts aforeſaid in teaching, (which they deny they have) ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, revelations and infallibility are ceaſed now, and Synods may err, (as they confeſſe in their late Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, which they there make good) then they are not the Apoſtles ſucceſſors (notwithſtanding their claim) becauſe we cannot believe that Chriſt meant a ſucceſſor of an identicall office of teaching, without the gifts that then were concomitant to the office, and were inherent to the officers, the ſaid Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>We wiſh them to conſult again, and lay down the claim of their office from the Apoſtles: unleſſe they will alſo lay claim to the like gifts in teaching with the Apoſtles, becauſe they were ſo neerly and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arily joyned toget her in there, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.9, 10, ends 11, 12. to enable them to perform their office to the ends and purpoſes expreſſed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. <q>Therefore what Jeſus Chriſt hath joyned together let none dare to put aſunder;</q> as to pretend to their predeceſſors office, and not to their gifts.</p>
               <p>Again, they call themſelves Paſtors and Teachers; now their miniſtration is not the ſame in office with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to whom Chriſt ſpake the foreſaid words.</p>
               <p>If they ſay all of them are included in theſe words, <q>Lo I am with you: becauſe it is ſaid '<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. that he gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, and ſome Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and ſome Paſtors, ſome Teachers:</q> we anſwer, that it is true, that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. there is an enumeration of ſeveral perſons concrete with their ſeveral offices: yet it will not follow on that account, though they be like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors or Teachers, that therefore thoſe officers are ſo inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the words, <q>
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. Lo I am with you to the

Hence it is we ſay, theſe words, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. will not afford them warrant to call themſelves what they do; but it had been much better for them to have laid hold on <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. and argued thus for their claim of Paſtors, &amp;c. There are Paſtors and Teachers mentioned in the ſaid place, and though they themſelves are not Apoſtles, or Prophets, or Evangeliſts, yet they are Paſtors and Teachers, and in theſe imployments Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt: we ſay it had been much better for them to have laid hold on that place for the end aforeſaid, becauſe they had held forth ſome more colour to juſtifie their office they pretend unto; but yet little more of rational evidence for what they ſay, ſave only ſtill an argumentation like that of the man for his Son to be the Biſhop afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. For though there be mention made of Paſtors and Teachers, and they are to be continued to the worlds end; will it follow therefore upon any other certainty then the argumentation aforeſaid, that they are their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors as Paſtors and Teachers in their generation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they can prove that <hi>id generis,</hi> that of the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite of gifts to be in them with their office, which were in the appointed Paſtors and Teachers mentioned <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:29469:139"/>Paſtors and Teachers; and it is undoubtedly intended to be conveyed by the impoſition of hands, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 6. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                  <q>I put thee in remembrance to ſtir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</q> Therefore that ceremony was a document to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure out the manner or reality of conveying the gift with the office by the Donor himſelf; but there is no mention made of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. becauſe Chriſt made Paſtors and Teachers as he himſelf was made a High-Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.6. 'after the power of endleſſe life; ſo they were made Paſtors by the power of endleſſe life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <q>When he aſcended he gave gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and ſo made ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers:</q> Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not one, but all were endued with gifts immediately by him who did appoint them their office. Now whether they had leſſe gifts then to be infallible in their teaching and inſtruction, is the buſineſſe to be inquired into; which we ſay they had not, from that which is expreſſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. where when there was a want found of ſupplying a defect, <hi>v.</hi> 1. then the twelve Diſciples, commonly called the Apoſtles; (and were thoſe ſent out <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20.) wiſhed them to look out among themſelves: (it ſeems it was not ſo rare, nor were they ignorant in thoſe times of ſuch endowed men, nor did they deny ſuch men extant who were full of eminent gifts men of honeſt report, and full of the Holy Ghoſt and wiſdome, which they found out; and the Apoſtles authoriſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them, <hi>v.</hi> 5.6. in their office, and left not that unto the people to do: henc therefore theſe Paſtors &amp; Teachers Chriſt intended, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. were ſuch, and ſo qualified, (we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) for the office of Paſtors, &amp;c. Hence alſo we ſay, if the ſeveral and reſpective Miniſters (claiming their miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as aforeſaid) will prove themſelves their ſucceſſors, (whether included or not included in the words, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20.) who are mentioned <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. and ſo the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Jeſus Chriſt, then they muſt demonſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be men of honeſt report amongſt. Apoſtolick-men
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:29469:139"/>(if there be any) and full of the Holy Ghoſt and wiſdome, even that wiſdome ſpecified <hi>Jan.</hi> 3.17. and not be puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with pride, and ſhewing bitterneſſe and wrath; and carry themſelves <hi>Diotrephes</hi>-like, loving ſo far to have the preeminence, as to have power to receive whom they think fit into the Miniſterial office, and to reject whom they affect not, becauſe they are not of their mind, though peradventure better qualified with ſaving truths then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yea do not only ſo, but forbid or hinder them that would receive them, or caſt them out of their lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>Hence we ſayagain, that if they derive their claim; as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, to be their ſucceſſors, they muſt be qualified like thoſe Paſtors, which we have proved to be qualified as aforeſaid by reaſon it is ſaid, <hi>Ephoſ.</hi> 4.11. they were of Chriſts own making and gifted with his immediate gifts, <hi>v.</hi> 8. which cannot be leſſe or fewer then fit for the ends they were appointed unto, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate whereof is to become a perfect man, (which moſt of our Miniſters deny to be in this life,) unto the meaſure of the ſtature (or age) of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> if they lay claim to be the ſucceſſors of the foreſaid Paſtors and Teachers, and ſo the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, they muſt be ſuch Paſtors, ſo made by Jeſus Chriſt inwardly; for their outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is but a ceremony, which they moſt frequently apply where there is not the thing ſignified, namely ſuch gifts in thoſe ordained men; which if there be, then they muſt firſt underſtand thoſe gifts to be, and own them, yea, imploy them for thoſe ends expreſſed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12.13. which ultimate end is denied by many to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life; and their great conteſt and zeal is to lay claim to the ſaid ſucceſſion, for to juſtifie their office, and not to have the office of Preſbyter, Miniſters and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to be extinct out of their Church, but we heare no diſputes nor can we ſee ſuch zeal and animoſities put forth to defend their claim to their predeceſſors gifts: but they can be content to ſay, yea to excuſe themſelves, to be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:29469:140"/>like other men (ſave only in the Grecians wiſdome and literature, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.) in paſſions and converſations, if not below other men, (as too often its to be feared;) but their office forſooth they would have looked upon as to be the Miniſters and Biſhops of Jeſus Chriſt; when the gifs aforeſaid of ſuch Paſtors <hi>Eheſ.</hi> 4.11. and of ſuch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops &amp; Deacons which are ſpecified, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5. &amp;c. are not to be found, yea not be believed can they be in theſe days; ſo that if the Son of man come again (as he will come) will he find faith? as its ſaid <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8. on the earth, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe ſorts of men,) to believe that there is any who can come while he liveth to a perfect ſtate in holineſſe? though its declared to be the end that all theſe officers are appointed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12, 13.</p>
               <p>The foreſaid men are ſo ſollicitous and careful to prove their office of miniſtration to be from the Apoſtles down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that when they are reproched as to have their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from the <hi>Pope</hi> and Popiſh Biſhops, (becauſe thoſe did once rule in <hi>England,</hi>) that they preſently deny it, and ſay (having bruſhed their veſti tures and pickt out the Croſſe) that they have caſt off the reliques of <hi>Rome,</hi> and only retain (they ſaid) the office, which indeed the Popes had from their immediate predeceſſors; and ſo they run to the top of the ſcale or ladder to ſee the Apoſtles deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (like the Angel on <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12.) to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them to be their ſucceſſors for matter of office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their gifts, as aforeſaid. But we believe that Chriſt meant by that place of Scripture otherwiſe then ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued future ſucceſſion to follow to the end of the world: for the words are, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <q>I am with you all the days to the end of that age.</q> Hence why may not we think Chriſt meant the like dayes, of which he biddeth them rell <hi>Herod</hi> that fox, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.23, 24. <q>Behold, I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I ſhall be perfected:</q> ſo all the days of their age or diſpenſation he would be with them to aſſiſt them in the accompliſhment of their cures or work; which like dayes are intimated, <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 6.2. <q>After
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:29469:140"/>two days he will revive us, and in the third we ſhall live in his ſight;</q> which Chriſt (we believe) calleth the laſt day, (and not the end of the world) when he ſaith, <q>and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day,</q> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, 40, 41. in a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel reſpect to the Lord Jeſus day, who was raiſed up at the laſt day; for it is ſaid, <q>he was dead and buried, and the third day he roſe again: ſo it is ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. &amp;c. We are buried with Chriſt by baptiſme into death, &amp;c. for if we have been planted together into the ſimilitude of his death, even ſo ſhall we be into the ſimilitude of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: which work of mortification to a new life the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were appointed to preach, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20.</q> until the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment 'of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p>In this foreſaid ſenſe the words may be juſtified to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken to the Apoſtles in their own perſons, but not in the ſenſe the words are tranſlated into, <q>Lo I am with you to the end of the world:</q> for ſo they cannot be literally true; therefore ſuch as deſired to hear of ſuch a ſucceſſion aforeſaid, and finding no fitter place in their apprehenſions, they preſently fancied Chriſts meaning to be in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, by ſaying 'Lo I am with you to the end of the world, that is, with you in your ſucceſſors: and then the next inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, themſelves are the Presbyters and Miniſters of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt meant (as aforeſaid) I will be 'with you in your ſucceſſors to the end of the world; which yet he may be with the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, and yet none of the publique miniſtration of <hi>England</hi> may be the ſaid Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Jeſus Chriſt, that is, according to his conſtitution and order; though many of them, we deny not (but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them) to be God-fearing men and wel meaning ſervants for Jeſus Chriſt; but yet we cannot believe them to be Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, that is, by his order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, by reaſon that we are more then confident that Chriſt would not have the office of the Apoſtles in their miniſtration ſeparated from the gifts concomitant and needfull thereunto; which we cannot yet find to be in them, yea they diſown them to be unattainable, and therefore not to be in theſe after days expected, though it be

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.9. and if they do ſo ſpeak and do, &amp;c. then we doubt not, (according to that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6.) <q>but the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Lord of Hoſts will ſuddenly return again to his Temple, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. and build up once again the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of <hi>David</hi> which is fallen down, &amp;c.</q>
